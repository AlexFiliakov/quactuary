# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## S02_M02_Quantum_Implementation

### Overview
This document defines the product requirements for integrating quantum algorithms into the quactuary package, enabling actuaries to leverage quantum computing for complex risk calculations while maintaining seamless compatibility with classical approaches.

### Problem Statement
Actuarial computations for risk assessment, pricing, and portfolio optimization often involve:
- High-dimensional probability distributions that are computationally expensive to simulate classically
- Complex dependency structures that scale exponentially with portfolio size
- Monte Carlo simulations requiring millions of samples for accurate risk measures
- Optimization problems that become intractable for large portfolios

Quantum computing offers potential exponential speedups for specific classes of these problems, particularly in:
- Amplitude estimation for risk measures (quadratic speedup over Monte Carlo)
- Quantum state preparation for probability distributions
- Quantum optimization for portfolio selection

### Goals and Objectives
1. **Primary Goal**: Integrate quantum algorithms seamlessly into the existing quactuary framework
2. **Objectives**:
   - Implement quantum versions of key actuarial algorithms starting with Excess Loss evaluation
   - Create an intelligent decision framework that automatically selects classical vs quantum algorithms
   - Maintain API compatibility so existing code can benefit from quantum speedups transparently
   - Provide clear performance benchmarks showing when quantum algorithms provide advantage
   - Enable both simulation and future hardware execution

### User Stories
1. **As an actuary**, I want to calculate excess loss premiums using quantum algorithms when they provide computational advantage, without changing my existing workflow.

2. **As a risk analyst**, I want to evaluate Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) using quantum amplitude estimation for faster convergence than Monte Carlo methods.

3. **As a portfolio manager**, I want the system to automatically choose between classical and quantum algorithms based on problem size and available resources.

4. **As a developer**, I want clear APIs to implement new quantum algorithms that integrate with the existing backend system.

5. **As a data scientist**, I want to benchmark quantum vs classical performance to understand when to use each approach.
