# Milestone: Quantum Implementation

## Goals
- Integrate quantum algorithms with classical features to enhance runtime and accuracy
- Implement Excess Loss Algorithm as primary quantum pricing algorithm
- Implement additional quantum pricing/risk algorithms from research papers
- Create intelligent classical-quantum decision logic for optimal algorithm selection

## Key Documents
- `PRD.md`
- `SPECS_API.md`
- `SPECS_TOOLS.md`

## Key Technology
- qiskit 1.4.2

## Resources
- Excess Loss notebook: https://github.com/AlexFiliakov/knowledge-pricing/blob/main/Quantum%20Excess%20Evaluation%20Algorithm.ipynb
- Research paper on quantum algorithms: https://arxiv.org/html/2410.20841v1#S7.SS1
- Additional quantum algorithms: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5949

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- Quantum algorithms integrated into the quactuary package
- Appropriate classical-quantum decision logic implemented
- Unit tests for quantum algorithms with coverage > 80%
- Performance benchmarks demonstrating quantum advantage for suitable problem sizes
- Documentation for quantum APIs and usage examples
- Integration tests showing seamless classical-quantum workflow

## Notes / Context
This milestone focuses on implementing quantum computing capabilities within the quactuary package, starting with the Excess Loss Algorithm and expanding to other quantum pricing and risk algorithms. The implementation should intelligently decide when to use quantum vs classical algorithms based on problem characteristics and available resources.
