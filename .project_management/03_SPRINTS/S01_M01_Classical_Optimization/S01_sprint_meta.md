# Sprint: Optimize Classical Simulations (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Implement classical insurance simulations of standard policy features and optimize the simulation algorithm.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
1. Implement all policy logic. The specific amounts are passed as variables, but all the features are listed in `book.py` class `PolicyTerms`
   - effective_date:-  date  # Effective date of the policy
   - expiration_date:- date  # Expiration date of the policy
   - lob:- - - - Optional[LOB] = None  # Line of business (optional)
   - exposure_base:-   Optional[ExposureBase] = None  # Exposure base (Payroll, Sales, Square Footage, Vehicles, Replacement Value etc.)
   - exposure_amount:- float = 0.0  # Exposure amount (e.g., limit, sum insured)
   - retention_type:-  str = "deductible"  # deductible / SIR
   - per_occ_retention:  float = 0.0  # retention per occurrence
   - agg_retention:-   Optional[float] = None  # aggregate retention
   - corridor_retention: Optional[float] = None  # corridor retention
   - coinsurance:- - Optional[float] = None  # 0 → 0% insured's share, 1.0 → 100% insured's share
   - per_occ_limit:-   Optional[float] = None  # per-occurrence limit (None if unlimited)
   - agg_limit:- -   Optional[float] = None  # aggregate limit (Optional)
   - attachment:- -  Optional[float] = None  # for XoL layers
      - (if attachment is confusing, you can leave out the implementation)
2. Implement compound distribution simplifications for all cases wherever possible for Frequency-Severity selections. For example:
   - Aggregate loss S = ∑(i=1 to N) Xi where N ~ Poisson(λ) and Xi ~ Gamma(α, β)
   - S follows a Tweedie distribution with:
     - Mean: E[S] = λ × α/β
     - Variance: Var[S] = λ × α/β² × (1 + α)
     - For integer α, can use negative binomial convolution
   - Research and implement all simplification cases.
   - The simplifications should never introduce error or reduce accuracy.
3. Implement Sobol Sequences to increase convergence and reduce tail variance.
4. Implement optimized simulation techniques such as optional parallel processing and JIT compilation with Numba. Research additional optimizations and implement them without reducing simulation accuracy.
