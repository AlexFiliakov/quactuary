# Task: Implement Compound Distribution Simplifications

## Description
Implement analytical solutions and computational simplifications for compound distributions (frequency-severity combinations) where mathematical closed-form solutions exist. This will significantly improve simulation performance and accuracy by avoiding Monte Carlo sampling when exact or highly accurate analytical methods are available.

## Goal / Objectives
- Identify all frequency-severity pairs that have known analytical solutions
- Implement these solutions within the existing distribution framework
- Provide automatic detection and switching to analytical methods when applicable
- Maintain exact accuracy - no approximations that reduce precision

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate seamlessly with existing frequency/severity distribution classes
- Support both analytical and simulation modes with automatic selection
- Maintain numerical stability for extreme parameter values
- Provide clear documentation of mathematical derivations
- Support quantum state preparation for analytical distributions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All implemented analytical solutions match Monte Carlo results within numerical precision
- [ ] Performance improvement of at least 100x for analytical cases vs simulation
- [ ] Automatic detection works correctly for all supported combinations
- [ ] Unit tests validate mathematical correctness against known results
- [ ] 95% test coverage for new compound distribution code

## Subtasks

### 1. Research and Document Compound Distribution Cases
- [ ] Document Poisson-Exponential → Exponential mixture
- [ ] Document Poisson-Gamma → Tweedie distribution properties
- [ ] Document Geometric-Exponential → Exponential distribution
- [ ] Document Negative Binomial-Gamma → Generalized Pareto cases
- [ ] Document Binomial-Lognormal approximations
- [ ] Research additional compound distribution pairs with known solutions
- [ ] Create mathematical reference document with derivations

### 2. Implement Core Framework
- [ ] Create `CompoundDistribution` base class in `distributions/compound.py`
- [ ] Implement `has_analytical_solution()` detection method
- [ ] Create `AnalyticalCompound` and `SimulatedCompound` subclasses
- [ ] Implement automatic switching logic based on distribution parameters
- [ ] Add registry pattern for compound distribution combinations

### 3. Implement Specific Analytical Solutions

#### Poisson-Gamma (Tweedie)
- [ ] Implement Tweedie distribution class
- [ ] Parameters: p (power), μ (mean), φ (dispersion)
- [ ] Relationships: λ = μ^(2-p)/[φ(2-p)], α = (2-p)/(p-1), β = φ(p-1)μ^(p-1)
- [ ] Support special cases: p=1 (Poisson), p=2 (Gamma), 1<p<2 (compound)

#### Poisson-Exponential  
- [ ] Implement analytical solution: S ~ Exponential(λ/θ)
- [ ] Where N ~ Poisson(λ), Xi ~ Exponential(θ)
- [ ] Include variance formula: Var(S) = 2λ/θ²

#### Geometric-Exponential
- [ ] Implement analytical solution: S ~ Exponential((1-p)/θ)
- [ ] Where N ~ Geometric(p), Xi ~ Exponential(θ)
- [ ] Handle edge case when p approaches 0 or 1

#### Negative Binomial-Gamma
- [ ] Implement using Beta-Gamma mixture representation
- [ ] Parameters: r (failures), p (probability), α (shape), β (rate)
- [ ] Use special functions for exact computation when possible

### 4. Implement Approximation Methods (High Accuracy)
- [ ] Implement Panjer recursion for discrete severities
- [ ] Implement Fast Fourier Transform method for continuous severities
- [ ] Implement moment-matching approximations with error bounds
- [ ] Add Edgeworth expansion for moderate sample sizes

### 5. Integration with Existing Framework
- [ ] Modify `PricingModel` to detect and use compound distributions
- [ ] Update frequency classes to expose compound distribution info
- [ ] Update severity classes to support analytical integration
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing simulation code

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated parameter combinations
- [ ] Use vectorized special functions (scipy.special)
- [ ] Add JIT compilation for numerical integration routines
- [ ] Benchmark against pure simulation approach

### 7. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create test cases comparing analytical vs simulation results
- [ ] Test edge cases: λ→0, λ→∞, extreme severity parameters
- [ ] Validate moment calculations (mean, variance, skewness)
- [ ] Test quantum state preparation for analytical distributions
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for each distribution pair

## Implementation Notes
- Tweedie distributions are crucial for insurance applications
- Some combinations may only have approximations - document accuracy
- Consider numerical stability for large λ or extreme severity parameters
- Maintain consistency with existing API - users shouldn't need to change code
