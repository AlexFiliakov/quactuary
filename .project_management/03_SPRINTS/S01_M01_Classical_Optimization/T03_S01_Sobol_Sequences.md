# Task: Implement Sobol Sequences

## Description
Implement Sobol Sequences to increase convergence and reduce tail variance. Refer to examples in `/quactuary/usage/Sobol Sequence Example.ipynb`

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement Sobol Sequences to increase convergence and reduce tail variance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement the subtasks in this file and describe reasons for any skipped implementations in section `## Output Log of this file`
- [ ] Design automated tests
- [ ] Initial automated tests pass with 95% `book.py` coverage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Identify places where Sobol Sequences can be utilized and log all identified compound distributions in this file's `## Output Log` section.
- [ ] Implement Sobol Sequences to increase convergence rate and reduce tail variance.
- [ ] Create automated tests to cover 95% of the implemented code.
