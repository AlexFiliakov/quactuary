# Task: Optimize Classical Simulation Performance

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations for classical Monte Carlo simulations, including parallel processing, JIT compilation, vectorization, and memory-efficient algorithms. The goal is to achieve significant speedup while maintaining accuracy and adding features like progress monitoring and adaptive memory management.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve 10-100x performance improvement through combined optimizations
- Implement adaptive memory management to handle large portfolios
- Add parallel processing with configurable worker counts
- Provide detailed performance profiling and progress monitoring
- Maintain or improve numerical accuracy

## Technical Requirements
- Support both CPU-bound and memory-bound optimization strategies
- Implement graceful degradation for resource-constrained environments
- Maintain thread safety for parallel operations
- Provide performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- Support both batch and streaming processing modes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance improvement of 10-100x on typical portfolios (baseline: naive loops)
- [ ] Memory usage stays within 80% of available RAM
- [ ] Parallel speedup of at least 0.7x per additional core
- [ ] All optimizations maintain numerical accuracy within 1e-10
- [ ] Performance profiler identifies bottlenecks accurately
- [ ] 95% test coverage for optimization code

## Subtasks

### 1. Baseline Performance Measurement
- [ ] Implement comprehensive benchmarking suite
- [ ] Profile current implementation with cProfile/line_profiler
- [ ] Identify computational bottlenecks (likely: random generation, distribution sampling)
- [ ] Measure memory usage patterns with memory_profiler
- [ ] Document baseline metrics for different portfolio sizes

### 2. Numba JIT Compilation
- [ ] Identify hot paths suitable for JIT compilation:
  - Distribution sampling functions
  - Loss aggregation routines
  - Policy term applications
- [ ] Implement Numba-compatible versions of core functions
- [ ] Use `@njit` for pure numerical functions
- [ ] Use `@jit` with object mode for complex functions
- [ ] Handle Numba limitations (no Python objects in nopython mode)
- [ ] Benchmark JIT overhead vs speedup tradeoff

### 3. Vectorization Strategy
- [ ] Replace scalar operations with numpy vector operations
- [ ] Implement batch processing for distribution sampling
- [ ] Vectorize policy term calculations across portfolio
- [ ] Use numpy broadcasting for efficient memory usage
- [ ] Optimize memory layout (row vs column major)
- [ ] Implement SIMD-friendly algorithms where possible

### 4. Memory Management
- [ ] Implement adaptive batch sizing based on available RAM:
  ```python
  def calculate_optimal_batch_size(n_policies, n_simulations):
      available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available
      memory_per_sim = estimate_memory_usage(n_policies)
      safety_factor = 0.8
      return min(n_simulations, int(available_memory * safety_factor / memory_per_sim))
  ```
- [ ] Add streaming mode for very large simulations
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for repeated allocations
- [ ] Use memory-mapped files for intermediate results
- [ ] Add garbage collection hints at strategic points

### 5. Parallel Processing
- [ ] Implement multiprocessing for embarrassingly parallel tasks
- [ ] Design thread pool for I/O-bound operations
- [ ] Use joblib for robust parallel execution:
  ```python
  from joblib import Parallel, delayed
  results = Parallel(n_jobs=n_workers, backend='loky')(
      delayed(simulate_batch)(batch) for batch in batches
  )
  ```
- [ ] Handle inter-process communication efficiently
- [ ] Implement work stealing for load balancing
- [ ] Add progress bar with tqdm for long-running simulations

### 6. Algorithm Optimizations
- [ ] Implement importance sampling for rare event simulation
- [ ] Add control variates for variance reduction
- [ ] Use antithetic variables where applicable
- [ ] Implement stratified sampling across policies
- [ ] Cache frequently computed values (e.g., distribution parameters)
- [ ] Optimize random number generation with PCG64

### 7. Progress Monitoring and Verbosity
- [ ] Add `verbose` parameter with levels:
  - 0: Silent
  - 1: Progress bar only
  - 2: Summary statistics
  - 3: Detailed scenario output
- [ ] Implement structured logging with performance metrics
- [ ] Add real-time convergence monitoring
- [ ] Provide estimated time remaining
- [ ] Show memory usage and CPU utilization

### 8. Performance Profiling Framework
- [ ] Create automated profiling decorators
- [ ] Implement flame graph generation
- [ ] Add line-by-line profiling for critical sections
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Build dashboard for performance metrics
- [ ] Document optimization decision tree

### 9. Configuration and Tuning
- [ ] Add `SimulationConfig` class with parameters:
  - `n_workers`: Number of parallel workers
  - `batch_size`: Manual or "auto"
  - `use_jit`: Enable/disable Numba
  - `memory_limit`: Maximum memory usage
  - `optimization_level`: 0-3 (none to aggressive)
- [ ] Implement auto-tuning for optimal parameters
- [ ] Add environment-based configuration
- [ ] Provide presets for common scenarios

### 10. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks across:
  - Portfolio sizes: 10, 100, 1000, 10000 policies
  - Simulation counts: 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M
  - Distribution types and parameters
- [ ] Validate numerical accuracy after each optimization
- [ ] Test memory limits and graceful degradation
- [ ] Verify thread safety with stress tests
- [ ] Compare results with reference implementation

## Implementation Notes
- Start with Numba JIT as it provides best effort/reward ratio
- Vectorization should be prioritized over parallelization
- Memory optimization is critical for large portfolios
- Consider GPU acceleration as future enhancement
- Profile regularly - premature optimization is counterproductive

## Performance Targets
- Small portfolios (10-100 policies): 50-100x speedup
- Medium portfolios (100-1000 policies): 20-50x speedup  
- Large portfolios (1000+ policies): 10-20x speedup
- Memory efficiency: <2GB for 1M simulations of 100 policies
