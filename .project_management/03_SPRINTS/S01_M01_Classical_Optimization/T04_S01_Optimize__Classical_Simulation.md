# Task: Optimize Classical Simulation Algorithms

## Description
Implement optimized simulation techniques such as optional parallel processing and JIT compilation with Numba. Research additional optimizations and implement them without reducing simulation accuracy.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement optimized simulation techniques such as optional parallel processing and JIT compilation with Numba.
- Research additional optimizations and implement them without reducing simulation accuracy.
- Reduce runtime by 100x-1000x on average from the current naive approach while improving accuracy.
- Vectorize operations if they will fit in memory, but if they's too large then the policy terms can be a point where processing is done sequentially to fit in memory. Perhaps you should analyze the the available RAM, estimate vectorized size, and determine the best approach to avoid locking up the system or crashing while still doing a reasonable amount of vectorization where practical.
- Make a `verbose=False` flag that will display individual scenarios in the output, but by default output only aggregate statistics with confidence intervals.
- Implement performance profiling and benchmarks for estimator variance, convergence per scenario, and runtime.
