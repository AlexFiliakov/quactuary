# T05_S01: Numerical Stability Module

## Description
Create a centralized numerical stability module to handle common numerical operations in a stable manner, particularly for compound distribution calculations and other actuarial computations that involve extreme values.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `quactuary/utils/numerical.py` module
- [ ] Implement stable log-space operations (log-sum-exp, log-product, etc.)
- [ ] Add automatic overflow/underflow detection and handling
- [ ] Provide stable implementations for common actuarial calculations
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
- [ ] Update existing compound distribution code to use new utilities
- [ ] Document best practices for numerical stability in codebase

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design numerical stability module architecture
- [ ] Implement core log-space utilities:
  - [ ] logsumexp with arbitrary dimension support
  - [ ] logaddexp for pairwise operations
  - [ ] stable_exp with overflow protection
  - [ ] stable_log with underflow protection
- [ ] Add numerical range checkers:
  - [ ] check_finite with informative error messages
  - [ ] clip_to_valid_range with configurable bounds
  - [ ] detect_numerical_issues for diagnostics
- [ ] Implement actuarial-specific utilities:
  - [ ] stable_probability_calculation
  - [ ] stable_moment_calculation
  - [ ] stable_quantile_interpolation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - [ ] Test extreme parameter values
  - [ ] Test near-zero and near-infinity cases
  - [ ] Test large array operations
- [ ] Refactor existing code:
  - [ ] Update compound.py to use new utilities
  - [ ] Update pricing.py numerical operations
  - [ ] Update quantum.py probability calculations
- [ ] Add documentation and examples

## Notes
This task emerged from numerical stability issues discovered during T02_S01 implementation, particularly in Tweedie weight calculations and Panjer recursion normalization.
