# T06_S01: Extended Distribution Support

## Description
Extend the compound distribution framework to support additional distribution combinations commonly used in actuarial practice, including zero-inflated models, mixed Poisson processes, and compound binomial distributions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement compound binomial distributions
- [ ] Implement mixed Poisson processes (Poisson-Gamma mixing)
- [ ] Implement zero-inflated compound models
- [ ] Add Edgeworth expansion for moderate sample sizes
- [ ] All new distributions integrate seamlessly with existing framework
- [ ] Performance comparable to existing compound distributions
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 95% for new distribution code
