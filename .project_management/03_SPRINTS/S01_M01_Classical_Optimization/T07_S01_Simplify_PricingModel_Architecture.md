# T07_S01: Simplify PricingModel Architecture

## Description
Refactor the PricingModel class to use composition instead of multiple inheritance, removing the broken quantum inheritance and creating a cleaner, more maintainable architecture. This addresses the critical architectural anti-pattern identified in the project review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove multiple inheritance from PricingModel class
- [ ] Implement composition pattern with strategy objects
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility for existing API
- [ ] Remove or fix broken quantum methods
- [ ] Improve code clarity and maintainability
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Performance remains equivalent or improves

## Subtasks

### 1. Analyze Current Architecture
- [ ] Document current PricingModel inheritance chain
- [ ] Identify which methods are actually used from each parent class
- [ ] Map dependencies between classical and quantum implementations
- [ ] Create migration plan preserving public API

### 2. Design Composition Architecture
- [ ] Create PricingStrategy interface/abstract base class
- [ ] Design ClassicalPricingStrategy concrete implementation
- [ ] Plan QuantumPricingStrategy interface (stub for future)
- [ ] Define clean dependency injection pattern

### 3. Implement Strategy Pattern
- [ ] Create new strategy classes:
  ```python
  class PricingStrategy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def calculate_portfolio_statistics(self, portfolio, **kwargs) -> PricingResult:
          pass
  
  class ClassicalPricingStrategy(PricingStrategy):
      def calculate_portfolio_statistics(self, portfolio, **kwargs) -> PricingResult:
          # Move logic from ClassicalPricingModel
          pass
  ```
- [ ] Move classical implementation from ClassicalPricingModel to strategy
- [ ] Create minimal QuantumPricingStrategy that raises NotImplementedError cleanly

### 4. Refactor PricingModel Class
- [ ] Remove inheritance from ClassicalPricingModel and QuantumPricingModel
- [ ] Add strategy composition:
  ```python
  class PricingModel:
      def __init__(self, portfolio: Portfolio, strategy: Optional[PricingStrategy] = None):
          self.portfolio = portfolio
          self.strategy = strategy or ClassicalPricingStrategy()
          self.compound_distribution = None
  ```
- [ ] Delegate method calls to strategy object
- [ ] Maintain existing method signatures for backward compatibility

### 5. Clean Up Legacy Classes
- [ ] Decide whether to keep ClassicalPricingModel as standalone
- [ ] Remove or significantly simplify QuantumPricingModel
- [ ] Update imports and dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused quantum infrastructure if not needed

### 6. Update Backend Integration
- [ ] Modify backend manager to work with strategy pattern
- [ ] Update simulate() method to use strategy selection
- [ ] Simplify backend switching logic
- [ ] Remove quantum backend checks if quantum not implemented

### 7. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Update existing tests to work with new architecture
- [ ] Add tests for strategy pattern implementation
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality still works
- [ ] Add tests for strategy switching
- [ ] Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression

### 8. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update docstrings to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Create examples showing strategy usage
- [ ] Document migration path for future quantum implementation
- [ ] Update architecture documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Preserve all existing public API methods
- Strategy pattern allows easy extension for future backends
- Cleaner separation of concerns between pricing logic and backend management
- Reduces complexity and makes testing easier
