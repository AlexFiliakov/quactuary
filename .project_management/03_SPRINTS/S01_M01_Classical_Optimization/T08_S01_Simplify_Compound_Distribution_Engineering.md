# T08_S01: Simplify Compound Distribution Engineering

## Description
Simplify the over-engineered compound distribution system by removing unnecessary abstractions, consolidating duplicate implementations, and replacing the complex registry/factory pattern with straightforward conditional logic. This addresses the "1200-line solution to a 200-line problem" critique.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reduce compound distribution code by at least 40%
- [ ] Replace registry pattern with simple factory method
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate analytical implementations
- [ ] Maintain all existing functionality and accuracy
- [ ] Improve code readability and maintainability
- [ ] All tests continue to pass
- [ ] Performance remains equivalent or improves

## Subtasks

### 1. Audit Current Implementation
- [ ] Count lines of code in compound.py (baseline measurement)
- [ ] Identify duplicate or unnecessary abstractions
- [ ] Map which analytical solutions are actually used
- [ ] Document current registry pattern complexity
- [ ] List all concrete compound distribution classes

### 2. Simplify Factory Pattern
- [ ] Replace complex registry with simple factory function:
  ```python
  def create_compound_distribution(frequency, severity):
      # Simple if-elif chain for known analytical solutions
      if isinstance(frequency, PoissonDistribution) and isinstance(severity, ExponentialDistribution):
          return PoissonExponentialCompound(frequency, severity)
      elif isinstance(frequency, PoissonDistribution) and isinstance(severity, GammaDistribution):
          return PoissonGammaCompound(frequency, severity)
      # ... other analytical cases
      else:
          return SimulatedCompound(frequency, severity)  # Monte Carlo fallback
  ```
- [ ] Remove AbstractCompoundDistribution registry methods
- [ ] Simplify CompoundDistribution.create() to use new factory
- [ ] Remove unnecessary class decorators and registration logic

### 3. Consolidate Analytical Implementations
- [ ] Review PoissonExponentialCompound vs alternatives
- [ ] Merge duplicate Tweedie implementations if any exist
- [ ] Remove redundant parameter validation (consolidate in base class)
- [ ] Simplify analytical solution methods
- [ ] Remove over-engineering in series expansions

### 4. Streamline Base Classes
- [ ] Simplify AbstractCompoundDistribution interface
- [ ] Remove unused abstract methods
- [ ] Consolidate common functionality in base class
- [ ] Remove unnecessary type checking and validation layers

### 5. Clean Up Approximation Methods
- [ ] Review if Panjer recursion and FFT are actually needed
- [ ] Consider removing if Monte Carlo is sufficient for current needs
- [ ] Keep only the approximations that provide clear value
- [ ] Simplify parameter handling for approximations

### 6. Remove Magic Numbers and Constants
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with named constants:
  ```python
  # Replace: if n_claims[i] > 30:
  MAX_EXACT_CLAIMS = 30
  if n_claims[i] > MAX_EXACT_CLAIMS:
  
  # Replace: if np.max(p_k * gamma_pdf) < 1e-10:
  CONVERGENCE_TOLERANCE = 1e-10
  if np.max(p_k * gamma_pdf) < CONVERGENCE_TOLERANCE:
  ```
- [ ] Document why each threshold was chosen
- [ ] Add configuration options for key parameters

### 7. Simplify Caching Strategy
- [ ] Remove complex caching if not providing clear benefit
- [ ] Use simple @lru_cache decorators for expensive computations
- [ ] Remove stateful caching that can become stale
- [ ] Document cache invalidation strategy

### 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Ensure all existing tests pass with simplified implementation
- [ ] Add tests for simplified factory method
- [ ] Remove tests for removed functionality
- [ ] Verify performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Test edge cases still work correctly

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Keep it working**: Make changes incrementally, ensuring tests pass at each step
2. **Measure everything**: Track line count reduction and performance impact
3. **Preserve accuracy**: All numerical results must remain identical
4. **Document decisions**: Explain what was removed and why

## Expected Outcomes
- Compound distribution module reduced from ~1200 to ~700 lines
- Simpler factory pattern that's easier to understand and extend
- Removed unnecessary abstractions and over-engineering
- Maintained functionality with improved maintainability
