# Task: Performance Testing Suite

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for all performance optimization modules to achieve 95% test coverage and ensure optimization components work correctly in isolation and combination.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve 95% test coverage for optimization code
- Create unit tests for all new optimization modules
- Add performance regression tests
- Integrate with existing test suite

## Technical Requirements
- Unit tests for all optimization classes and functions
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Performance benchmarks as part of test suite
- Automated regression testing for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 95% test coverage for benchmarks.py
- [ ] 95% test coverage for vectorized_simulation.py
- [ ] 95% test coverage for memory_management.py
- [ ] 95% test coverage for parallel_processing.py
- [ ] Unit tests for all public methods and classes
- [ ] Tests pass in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Performance regression tests added to test suite

## Subtasks

- [ ] Test VectorizedSimulator.simulate_inforce_vectorized_v2
- [ ] Test apply_policy_terms_vectorized
- [ ] Test calculate_statistics_vectorized
- [ ] Verify numerical accuracy vs standard implementation

### 3. Memory Management Tests
- [ ] Test MemoryManager.calculate_optimal_batch_size
- [ ] Test MemoryManager.estimate_memory_usage

- [ ] Mock psutil.virtual_memory

### 4. Parallel Processing Tests
- [ ] Test ParallelSimulator with mock executors
- [ ] Test chunk size calculation
- [ ] Test work-stealing algorithm
- [ ] Test error handling in parallel execution
- [ ] Test with different backend configurations

### 5. Integration with Existing Tests
- [ ] Update existing pricing tests to include optimization flags
- [ ] Add optimization tests to test_pricing.py
- [ ] Create test fixtures for optimization scenarios
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### 6. Performance Regression Tests
- [ ] Create baseline performance measurements
- [ ] Add automated performance benchmarks
- [ ] Set performance thresholds for CI
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

## Implementation Notes
- Use pytest framework consistent with existing tests
- Mock external dependencies (psutil, multiprocessing) for consistent testing
- Create small test portfolios for fast test execution
- Use parametrized tests for different optimization combinations
