# Task: Fix Parallel Processing Stability Issues

## Description
Investigate and resolve stability issues encountered in the parallel processing implementation to ensure robust multiprocessing execution across different environments and workloads.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve stable parallel execution across all supported platforms
- Reach target of 0.7x speedup per additional core
- Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully
- Optimize for different types of workloads

## Technical Requirements
- Stable multiprocessing without deadlocks or crashes
- Proper resource cleanup and memory management
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Graceful degradation when parallel execution fails

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parallel speedup of at least 0.7x per additional core consistently
- [ ] No deadlocks or crashes in stress testing
- [ ] Proper handling of worker process failures
- [ ] Memory usage stays within limits during parallel execution
- [ ] Works reliably across different Python versions and platforms

## Subtasks

### 1. Stability Investigation
- [ ] Reproduce parallel processing issues systematically
- [ ] Identify root causes (deadlocks, memory issues, serialization)
- [ ] Test across different Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- [ ] Test on different platforms (Windows WSL, Linux, macOS if available)

### 2. Process Management Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper process lifecycle management
- [ ] Add timeout handling for worker processes
- [ ] Improve error propagation from workers
- [ ] Add resource monitoring and limits
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures

### 3. Memory and Serialization Fixes
- [ ] Optimize data serialization for multiprocessing
- [ ] Implement shared memory for large arrays when possible
- [ ] Add memory pressure detection and mitigation
- [ ] Fix any pickle/serialization issues

### 4. Work Distribution Optimization
- [ ] Improve work-stealing algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Add dynamic load balancing
- [ ] Optimize chunk size calculation
- [ ] Handle heterogeneous worker performance

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all failure modes
- [ ] Implement automatic retry logic
- [ ] Add fallback to single-threaded execution
- [ ] Improve error reporting and diagnostics

### 6. Performance Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive parallel performance benchmarks
- [ ] Validate 0.7x speedup per core target
- [ ] Test with various portfolio sizes and simulation counts
- [ ] Measure and optimize overhead costs

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on the multiprocessing backend first as it's most commonly used
- Consider using more robust libraries like joblib's loky backend
- Add extensive logging for debugging parallel issues
- Use context managers for proper resource cleanup
- Test with both CPU-bound and memory-bound workloads
