# Task: Performance Optimization Integration Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive integration tests that validate the combination of different optimization strategies (JIT, vectorization, parallel processing, memory management) work correctly together and achieve expected performance improvements.

## Goal / Objectives
- Validate optimization combinations work correctly together
- Test end-to-end performance improvements
- Ensure optimization selection logic is correct
- Create integration test scenarios for different use cases

## Technical Requirements
- Test all combinations of optimization strategies
- Validate numerical accuracy across optimization combinations
- Test automatic optimization selection based on portfolio characteristics
- Performance testing with realistic workloads

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All optimization combinations tested and working
- [ ] End-to-end performance improvements validated
- [ ] Numerical accuracy maintained across all combinations
- [ ] Automatic optimization selection works correctly
- [ ] Integration tests run in reasonable time (<10 minutes)
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and boundary conditions

## Subtasks
