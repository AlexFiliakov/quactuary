## Subtasks

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create integration test framework structure:
  ```
  tests/integration/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── conftest.py  # Shared fixtures
  ├── test_optimization_combinations.py
  ├── test_end_to_end_scenarios.py
  ├── test_performance_validation.py
  └── benchmarks/
      ├── baseline_results.json
      └── performance_tracking.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for different portfolio sizes
- [ ] Create performance measurement decorators
- [ ] Set up memory profiling utilities
- [ ] Implement test data generators for reproducibility
- [ ] Configure pytest markers for integration tests:
  ```python
  # pytest.ini additions
  markers =
    integration: integration tests
    slow: tests that take > 1 minute
    memory_intensive: tests requiring > 4GB RAM
  ```

### 2. Optimization Combination Matrix Testing
- [ ] Create parameterized test matrix:
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.parametrize("jit,qmc,parallel,vectorized,memory_opt", [

      (False, True, False, False, False),  # QMC only
      # ... all 32 combinations
  ])
  ```

## Implementation Notes & Best Practices

### Testing Philosophy
- **Property-based testing**: Use hypothesis for invariant testing
  ```python
  @given(portfolios(min_size=10, max_size=1000))
  def test_optimization_preserves_mean(portfolio):
      assert abs(optimized.mean() - baseline.mean()) < 1e-6
  ```
- **Fixture design**: Hierarchical fixtures for efficiency
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def large_portfolio():  # Expensive, reused across tests
  
  @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
  def portfolio_copy(large_portfolio):  # Cheap copy for isolation
  ```
- **Timeout management**: Graduated timeout strategy
  - Unit tests: 10 seconds
  - Integration tests: 5 minutes
  - Performance tests: 30 minutes
  - Use `pytest-timeout` for enforcement

### Performance Testing Strategy
- Establish baseline before any optimization
- Use statistical methods (not single runs)
- Account for system variability
- Test both cold and warm scenarios
- Profile before optimizing

### Data Management
- Use deterministic seeds for reproducibility
- Store test data in HDF5/Parquet for efficiency
- Version control test data schemas
- Implement data generators for scale testing

### Debugging Support
- Comprehensive logging in tests
- Save failing test artifacts
- Implement test replay functionality
- Visual debugging tools for distributions
