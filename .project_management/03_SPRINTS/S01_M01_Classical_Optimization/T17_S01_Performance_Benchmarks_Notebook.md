# Task: Performance Benchmarks vs SciPy/NumPy

## Objective
Create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that benchmarks the performance of quactuary's extended distribution implementations against scipy/numpy baselines, demonstrating computational efficiency and identifying performance advantages.

## Detailed Description
Following the comprehensive testing implemented in T16, create a notebook that systematically benchmarks all extended distribution implementations against equivalent scipy/numpy implementations where available. The notebook should provide clear performance metrics, visualizations, and insights for users to understand when to use quactuary's implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [x] Create examples/performance_benchmarks_vs_scipy_numpy.ipynb
2. [x] Benchmark compound binomial distributions vs scipy equivalents
3. [x] Benchmark mixed Poisson processes vs manual implementations
4. [x] Benchmark zero-inflated models vs custom scipy-based code
5. [x] Benchmark Edgeworth expansion vs normal approximations
6. [x] Include timing comparisons for PDF/CDF/PPF/RVS operations
7. [x] Add memory usage profiling where relevant
8. [x] Create performance visualization plots
9. [x] Document performance advantages and trade-offs
10. [x] Include recommendations for different use cases

## Subtasks
1. [x] Setup and Introduction
   - Import all necessary libraries
   - Create helper functions for benchmarking
   - Define performance metrics to track
   
2. [x] Compound Binomial Benchmarks
   - Compare analytical vs simulation approaches
   - Benchmark Panjer recursion efficiency
   - Test different parameter ranges
   
3. [x] Mixed Poisson Benchmarks
   - Compare with scipy negative binomial
   - Benchmark hierarchical model performance
   - Test time-varying intensity computations
   
4. [x] Zero-Inflated Model Benchmarks
   - Compare EM algorithm convergence speed
   - Benchmark against manual ZI implementations
   - Test parameter estimation efficiency
   
5. [x] Edgeworth Expansion Benchmarks
   - Compare with normal approximation speed
   - Benchmark different expansion orders
   - Test accuracy vs speed trade-offs
   
6. [x] Visualization and Analysis
   - Create timing comparison plots
   - Generate accuracy vs performance charts
   - Build recommendation matrix

## Dependencies
- Requires T16_S01_Extended_Distribution_Testing to be complete
- All distribution implementations from T06

## Technical Notes
- Use %timeit for micro-benchmarks
- Include both small and large parameter scenarios
- Test vectorized operations where applicable
- Consider caching effects in benchmarks
- Document any scipy version dependencies
