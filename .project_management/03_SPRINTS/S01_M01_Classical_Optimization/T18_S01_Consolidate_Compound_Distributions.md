# Task: Consolidate Compound Distributions

## Description
Consolidate the compound distribution implementations from compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a single, well-organized module.

## Goal / Objectives
- Merge compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a unified implementation
- Eliminate code duplication while preserving all functionality
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- Analyze features in both files and create feature matrix
- Use best implementation for each feature
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Update all imports throughout codebase
- Preserve API compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single compound.py file containing all compound distribution functionality
- [ ] compound_extensions.py removed
- [ ] All imports updated successfully
- [ ] All tests passing with no regressions
- [ ] Code coverage maintained at 95%+
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API

## Subtasks

### 1. Feature Analysis
- [ ] Create detailed comparison of compound.py vs compound_extensions.py
  - Document every class, method, and function in both files
  - Create feature matrix showing which file has which capabilities
  - Identify exact duplicates vs similar implementations with differences
  - Note any API differences in method signatures or return types
- [ ] Identify unique features in each file
  - List features only in compound.py
  - List features only in compound_extensions.py
  - Identify which implementations are superior for shared features
- [ ] Document any API differences
  - Parameter naming differences
  - Return type differences
  - Method availability differences
- [ ] Determine optimal merge strategy
  - Decision matrix for which implementation to keep
  - Plan for handling API differences (compatibility layer vs breaking change)
  - Strategy for deprecation warnings if needed

### 2. Implementation Consolidation
- [ ] Create backup of both files
  - Git branch: feature/consolidate-compound-distributions
  - Copy files to backup/ directory as safety measure
- [ ] Test coverage analysis before merge
  - Run coverage on compound.py alone
  - Run coverage on compound_extensions.py alone
  - Identify any gaps that need tests before consolidation
- [ ] Merge unique features from compound_extensions.py into compound.py
  - Start with non-conflicting additions (new classes/methods)
  - Handle conflicting implementations based on feature analysis
  - Preserve best implementation for each feature
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations
  - Keep more efficient/cleaner implementation
  - Ensure all functionality is preserved
  - Add compatibility aliases if needed for backward compatibility
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming and organization
  - Group related functionality together
  - Follow consistent parameter naming conventions
  - Add section comments for different distribution types

### 3. Import Updates
- [ ] Find all files importing from compound_extensions
  ```bash
  grep -r "from.*compound_extensions import\|import.*compound_extensions" .
  ```
- [ ] Update imports to use consolidated compound module
  - Replace compound_extensions imports with compound
  - Verify imported names still exist
  - Update any fully qualified references
- [ ] Verify no broken imports remain
  - Run test suite after each batch of import updates
  - Check example notebooks
  - Verify documentation examples

### 4. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
  - All unit tests should pass
  - Integration tests should pass
  - No new test failures introduced
- [ ] Verify all compound distribution tests pass
  - test_compound.py
  - test_compound_binomial.py
  - test_compound_binomial_comprehensive.py
  - Any other compound-related tests
- [ ] Check code coverage metrics
  - Coverage should not decrease
  - Aim to maintain 95%+ coverage
  - Add tests for any uncovered consolidated code
- [ ] Test example notebooks still work
  - Extended_Distributions_Examples.ipynb
  - Portfolio Example.ipynb
  - Any other notebooks using compound distributions
- [ ] Performance verification
  - Run benchmarks before and after consolidation
  - Ensure no performance regression
  - Document any performance improvements

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update module docstring in compound.py
  - Reflect all available distributions
  - Update examples to show new capabilities
  - Document any API changes
- [ ] Update API documentation
  - Regenerate autodocs
  - Verify all classes/methods documented
  - Add migration guide if API changed
- [ ] Update user guide if needed
  - Reflect consolidated module structure
  - Update import examples
  - Note any deprecations

## Implementation Notes
- This task was extracted from T11_S01_Code_Cleanup_and_Simplification
- Focus on preserving functionality while improving organization
- Consider adding deprecation warnings if any APIs change
