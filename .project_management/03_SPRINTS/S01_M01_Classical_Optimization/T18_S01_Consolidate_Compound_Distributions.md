# Task: Consolidate Compound Distributions

## Description
Consolidate the compound distribution implementations from compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a single, well-organized module.

## Goal / Objectives
- Merge compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a unified implementation
- Eliminate code duplication while preserving all functionality
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- Analyze features in both files and create feature matrix
- Use best implementation for each feature
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Update all imports throughout codebase
- Preserve API compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single compound.py file containing all compound distribution functionality
- [ ] compound_extensions.py removed
- [ ] All imports updated successfully
- [ ] All tests passing with no regressions
- [ ] Code coverage maintained at 95%+
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API

## Subtasks

### 1. Feature Analysis
- [ ] Create detailed comparison of compound.py vs compound_extensions.py
- [ ] Identify unique features in each file
- [ ] Document any API differences
- [ ] Determine optimal merge strategy

### 2. Implementation Consolidation
- [ ] Create backup of both files
- [ ] Merge unique features from compound_extensions.py into compound.py
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming and organization

### 3. Import Updates
- [ ] Find all files importing from compound_extensions
- [ ] Update imports to use consolidated compound module
- [ ] Verify no broken imports remain

### 4. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify all compound distribution tests pass
- [ ] Check code coverage metrics
- [ ] Test example notebooks still work

## Implementation Notes
- This task was extracted from T11_S01_Code_Cleanup_and_Simplification
- Focus on preserving functionality while improving organization
- Consider adding deprecation warnings if any APIs change
