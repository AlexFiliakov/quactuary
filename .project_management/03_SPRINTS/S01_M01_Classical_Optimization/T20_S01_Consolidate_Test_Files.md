# Task: Consolidate Test Files

## Description
Consolidate duplicate and related test files to improve test organization and reduce redundancy.

## Goal / Objectives
- Merge related test files for compound distributions
- Organize test files by feature area
- Eliminate test duplication
- Improve test discoverability

## Technical Requirements
- Preserve all existing test coverage
- Maintain clear test organization
- Use pytest best practices
- Keep tests fast and isolated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Compound distribution tests consolidated
- [ ] No duplicate test cases
- [ ] Clear test file naming convention
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at 95%+
- [ ] Test execution time not increased

## Subtasks

### 1. Compound Distribution Test Consolidation
- [ ] Analyze test files: test_compound.py, test_compound_binomial.py, test_compound_binomial_comprehensive.py
- [ ] Identify duplicate vs unique test cases
- [ ] Create consolidated test structure
- [ ] Merge tests preserving all coverage
- [ ] Remove redundant test files

### 2. Test Organization Review
- [ ] Review test directory structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming patterns
- [ ] Group related tests appropriately
- [ ] Update test discovery patterns if needed

### 3. Test Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify slow tests
- [ ] Add appropriate pytest markers (slow, integration)
- [ ] Optimize test fixtures for reuse
- [ ] Reduce test data generation overhead

### 4. Documentation Update
- [ ] Update test documentation
- [ ] Document test organization strategy
- [ ] Add testing guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md

## Implementation Notes
- Use pytest fixtures effectively to reduce duplication
- Consider parametrized tests for similar test cases
- Maintain backward compatibility for CI/CD
