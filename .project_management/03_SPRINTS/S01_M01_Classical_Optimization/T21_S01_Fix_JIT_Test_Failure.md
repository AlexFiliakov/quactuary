# Task: Fix JIT Test Failure

## Description
Fix the failing test in test_jit_speedup.py that was moved from the main quactuary directory to the tests directory.

## Goal / Objectives
- Diagnose and fix the test failure
- Ensure test runs successfully in new location
- Verify JIT speedup functionality works correctly

## Technical Requirements
- Identify root cause of test failure
- Fix import paths or dependencies
- Ensure test is meaningful and not flaky
- Maintain test performance assertions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] test_jit_speedup.py passes all tests
- [ ] No import errors or path issues
- [ ] JIT speedup assertions are meaningful
- [ ] Test is not flaky or environment-dependent

## Subtasks

### 1. Diagnose Test Failure
- [ ] Run test in isolation to see exact error
- [ ] Check if failure is due to import paths
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are available
- [ ] Check for environment-specific issues

### 2. Fix Implementation
- [ ] Update import paths if needed
- [ ] Fix any module resolution issues
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation
- [ ] Address any timing or performance issues

### 3. Improve Test Robustness
- [ ] Add proper error messages
- [ ] Make performance thresholds configurable
- [ ] Add skip conditions for missing dependencies
- [ ] Document test requirements

### 4. Verification
- [ ] Run test multiple times to ensure stability
- [ ] Test in different environments
- [ ] Verify JIT speedup is actually measured
- [ ] Update test documentation

## Implementation Notes
- This test was moved from quactuary/test_jit_speedup.py to tests/test_jit_speedup.py
- May need to update relative imports
- Consider if test belongs in performance test suite
