## Implementation Notes
- Start with Numba JIT as it provides best effort/reward ratio
- Vectorization should be prioritized over parallelization
- Memory optimization is critical for large portfolios
- Consider GPU acceleration as future enhancement
- Profile regularly - premature optimization is counterproductive

## Performance Targets
- Small portfolios (10-100 policies): 50-100x speedup
- Medium portfolios (100-1000 policies): 20-50x speedup  
- Large portfolios (1000+ policies): 10-20x speedup
- Memory efficiency: <2GB for 1M simulations of 100 policies
