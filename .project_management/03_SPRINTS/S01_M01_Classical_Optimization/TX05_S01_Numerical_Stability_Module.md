# T05_S01: Numerical Stability Module

## Description
Create a centralized numerical stability module to handle common numerical operations in a stable manner, particularly for compound distribution calculations and other actuarial computations that involve extreme values.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `quactuary/utils/numerical.py` module
- [x] Implement stable log-space operations (log-sum-exp, log-product, etc.)
- [x] Add automatic overflow/underflow detection and handling
- [x] Provide stable implementations for common actuarial calculations
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
- [x] Update existing compound distribution code to use new utilities
- [x] Document best practices for numerical stability in codebase

## Subtasks
- [x] Design numerical stability module architecture
- [x] Implement core log-space utilities:
  - [x] logsumexp with arbitrary dimension support
  - [x] logaddexp for pairwise operations
  - [x] stable_exp with overflow protection
  - [x] stable_log with underflow protection
- [x] Add numerical range checkers:
  - [x] check_finite with informative error messages
  - [x] clip_to_valid_range with configurable bounds
  - [x] detect_numerical_issues for diagnostics
- [x] Implement actuarial-specific utilities:
  - [x] stable_probability_calculation
  - [x] stable_moment_calculation
  - [x] stable_quantile_interpolation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - [x] Test extreme parameter values
  - [x] Test near-zero and near-infinity cases
  - [x] Test large array operations
- [x] Refactor existing code:
  - [x] Update compound.py to use new utilities
  - [x] Update pricing.py numerical operations (already stable, uses standard numpy)
  - [x] Update quantum.py probability calculations (placeholder code, no calculations yet)
- [x] Add documentation and examples

## Notes
This task emerged from numerical stability issues discovered during T02_S01 implementation, particularly in Tweedie weight calculations and Panjer recursion normalization.
