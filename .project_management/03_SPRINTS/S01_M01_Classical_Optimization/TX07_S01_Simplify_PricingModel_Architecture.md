# T07_S01: Simplify PricingModel Architecture

## Description
Refactor the PricingModel class to use composition instead of multiple inheritance, removing the broken quantum inheritance and creating a cleaner, more maintainable architecture. This addresses the critical architectural anti-pattern identified in the project review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove multiple inheritance from PricingModel class
- [x] Implement composition pattern with strategy objects
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility for existing API
- [x] Remove or fix broken quantum methods
- [x] Improve code clarity and maintainability
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] Performance remains equivalent or improves

## Subtasks

### 1. Analyze Current Architecture
- [x] Document current PricingModel inheritance chain
- [x] Identify which methods are actually used from each parent class
- [x] Map dependencies between classical and quantum implementations
- [x] Create migration plan preserving public API

### 2. Design Composition Architecture
- [x] Create PricingStrategy interface/abstract base class
- [x] Design ClassicalPricingStrategy concrete implementation
- [x] Plan QuantumPricingStrategy interface (stub for future)
- [x] Define clean dependency injection pattern

### 3. Implement Strategy Pattern
- [x] Create new strategy classes:
  ```python
  class PricingStrategy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def calculate_portfolio_statistics(self, portfolio, **kwargs) -> PricingResult:
          pass
  
  class ClassicalPricingStrategy(PricingStrategy):
      def calculate_portfolio_statistics(self, portfolio, **kwargs) -> PricingResult:
          # Move logic from ClassicalPricingModel
          pass
  ```
- [x] Move classical implementation from ClassicalPricingModel to strategy
- [x] Create minimal QuantumPricingStrategy that raises NotImplementedError cleanly

### 4. Refactor PricingModel Class
- [x] Remove inheritance from ClassicalPricingModel and QuantumPricingModel
- [x] Add strategy composition:
  ```python
  class PricingModel:
      def __init__(self, portfolio: Portfolio, strategy: Optional[PricingStrategy] = None):
          self.portfolio = portfolio
          self.strategy = strategy or ClassicalPricingStrategy()
          self.compound_distribution = None
  ```
- [x] Delegate method calls to strategy object
- [x] Maintain existing method signatures for backward compatibility

### 5. Clean Up Legacy Classes
- [x] Decide whether to keep ClassicalPricingModel as standalone
- [x] Remove or significantly simplify QuantumPricingModel
- [x] Update imports and dependencies
- [x] Remove unused quantum infrastructure if not needed

### 6. Update Backend Integration
- [x] Modify backend manager to work with strategy pattern
- [x] Update simulate() method to use strategy selection
- [x] Simplify backend switching logic
- [x] Remove quantum backend checks if quantum not implemented

### 7. Testing and Validation
- [x] Update existing tests to work with new architecture
- [x] Add tests for strategy pattern implementation
- [x] Verify all existing functionality still works
- [x] Add tests for strategy switching
- [x] Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression

### 8. Documentation Updates
- [x] Update docstrings to reflect new architecture
- [x] Create examples showing strategy usage
- [x] Document migration path for future quantum implementation
- [x] Update architecture documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Preserve all existing public API methods
- Strategy pattern allows easy extension for future backends
- Cleaner separation of concerns between pricing logic and backend management
- Reduces complexity and makes testing easier

## Output Log
[2025-05-25 02:37]: Task started - Beginning analysis of current PricingModel architecture
[2025-05-25 02:42]: Subtask 1 COMPLETE - Architecture analysis reveals:
  - PricingModel uses multiple inheritance: ClassicalPricingModel + QuantumPricingModel
  - Both parents have conflicting calculate_portfolio_statistics() methods  
  - Manual backend dispatching in simulate() method creates coupling
  - QuantumPricingModel appears incomplete (placeholder implementation)
  - Main methods used: calculate_portfolio_statistics(), __init__()
  - Public API: simulate(), set_compound_distribution(), calculate_aggregate_statistics()
  - Migration plan: Replace inheritance with composition using strategy pattern
[2025-05-25 02:44]: Subtask 2 COMPLETE - Created pricing_strategies.py with:
  - PricingStrategy ABC with standardized interface
  - ClassicalPricingStrategy delegates to existing implementation  
  - QuantumPricingStrategy stub with clean NotImplementedError
  - get_strategy_for_backend() factory function for dependency injection
[2025-05-25 02:46]: Subtask 3 COMPLETE - Strategy classes already implemented in previous step
[2025-05-25 02:48]: Subtask 4 COMPLETE - Refactored PricingModel class:
  - Removed multiple inheritance, now uses clean composition
  - Added strategy parameter to constructor with ClassicalPricingStrategy default
  - Simplified simulate() method to delegate to strategy
  - Maintained backward compatibility for existing public API
  - Eliminated manual backend dispatching logic
[2025-05-25 02:50]: Subtask 5 COMPLETE - Legacy class cleanup:
  - Kept ClassicalPricingModel as standalone (used by strategy)
  - QuantumPricingModel handled via strategy stub
  - Updated imports to remove unused dependencies
[2025-05-25 02:52]: Subtask 6 COMPLETE - Backend integration updated:
  - Strategy pattern integrates with get_strategy_for_backend()
  - Backend override in simulate() uses temporary strategy
  - Simplified backend switching logic
[2025-05-25 02:54]: Subtask 7 COMPLETE - Testing and validation:
  - Existing test_pricing.py passes with new architecture
  - Created comprehensive test_pricing_strategies.py with 8 tests
  - Verified backward compatibility and strategy delegation
  - All tests pass, no performance regression detected
[2025-05-25 02:56]: Subtask 8 COMPLETE - Documentation updated:
  - Updated PricingModel docstrings to reflect composition pattern
  - Strategy classes have comprehensive documentation
  - Implementation shows clear migration path for quantum features
