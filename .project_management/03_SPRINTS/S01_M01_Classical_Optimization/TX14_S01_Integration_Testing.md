  ├── test_optimization_combinations.py
  ├── test_end_to_end_scenarios.py
  ├── test_performance_validation.py
  └── benchmarks/
      ├── baseline_results.json

  ```
- [x] Implement test fixtures for different portfolio sizes
- [x] Create performance measurement decorators

## Implementation Notes & Best Practices

### Testing Philosophy
- **Property-based testing**: Use hypothesis for invariant testing
  ```python
  @given(portfolios(min_size=10, max_size=1000))
  def test_optimization_preserves_mean(portfolio):
      assert abs(optimized.mean() - baseline.mean()) < 1e-6
  ```
- **Fixture design**: Hierarchical fixtures for efficiency
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def large_portfolio():  # Expensive, reused across tests
  
  @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
  def portfolio_copy(large_portfolio):  # Cheap copy for isolation
  ```
- **Timeout management**: Graduated timeout strategy
  - Unit tests: 10 seconds
  - Integration tests: 5 minutes
  - Performance tests: 30 minutes
  - Use `pytest-timeout` for enforcement

### Performance Testing Strategy
- Establish baseline before any optimization
- Use statistical methods (not single runs)
- Account for system variability
- Test both cold and warm scenarios
- Profile before optimizing

### Data Management
- Use deterministic seeds for reproducibility
- Store test data in HDF5/Parquet for efficiency
- Version control test data schemas
- Implement data generators for scale testing

### Debugging Support
- Comprehensive logging in tests
- Save failing test artifacts
- Implement test replay functionality
- Visual debugging tools for distributions

## Performance Targets & Acceptance Thresholds

### Speed Improvements
| Portfolio Size | Baseline Time | Target Speedup | Minimum Acceptable |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Small (10-100) | 1-10 seconds  | 10-50x         | 5x                 |
| Medium (100-1K)| 10-60 seconds | 20-75x         | 10x                |
| Large (1K+)    | 1-10 minutes  | 10-100x        | 8x                 |
| Extreme (10K+) | 10+ minutes   | 50-200x        | 20x                |
