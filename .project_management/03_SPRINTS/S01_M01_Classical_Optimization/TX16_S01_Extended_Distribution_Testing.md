# Task: Comprehensive Testing for Extended Distributions

## Objective
Create comprehensive test coverage for all extended distribution implementations added in T06, ensuring mathematical correctness, numerical stability, and edge case handling.

## Detailed Description
The extended distribution support added significant mathematical complexity. This task ensures all implementations are thoroughly tested against theoretical properties, edge cases, and numerical stability requirements documented in the mathematical reference.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Test coverage for all compound binomial distributions
2. [ ] Test coverage for all mixed Poisson processes
3. [ ] Test coverage for zero-inflated models with EM algorithm
4. [ ] Test coverage for Edgeworth expansion framework
5. [ ] Property-based tests validating mathematical properties
6. [ ] Edge case tests for parameter boundaries
7. [ ] Numerical stability tests for extreme parameters
8. [ ] Integration tests with factory functions
9. [ ] Performance benchmarks vs scipy/numpy baselines

## Subtasks
1. [x] Create test_compound_binomial_comprehensive.py
   - Test analytical formulas for Binomial-Exponential
   - Test Bessel function calculations for Binomial-Gamma
   - Test Fenton-Wilkinson approximation accuracy
   - Test Panjer recursion convergence
   
2. [x] Create test_mixed_poisson_comprehensive.py
   - Test overdispersion in Poisson-Gamma
   - Test heavy tails in Poisson-Inverse Gaussian
   - Test hierarchical model variance components
   - Test time-varying intensity functions
   
3. [x] Create test_zero_inflated_comprehensive.py
   - Test EM algorithm convergence
   - Test Vuong test statistics
   - Test score test implementation
   - Test parameter recovery simulations
   
4. [x] Create test_edgeworth_comprehensive.py
   - Test Hermite polynomial calculations
   - Test series convergence criteria
   - Test Cornish-Fisher quantile accuracy
   - Test automatic order selection
   
5. [x] Create property-based tests
   - Moment matching validation
   - Distribution bounds checking
   - Monotonicity of CDFs
   - Numerical stability under stress

## Dependencies
- Requires T06_S01_Extended_Distribution_Support to be complete
- Mathematical reference document for theoretical values

## Technical Notes
- Use hypothesis for property-based testing
- Compare against R actuarial packages where available
- Use Monte Carlo validation for complex distributions
- Document any numerical tolerance requirements
