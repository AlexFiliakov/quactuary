# Task: Performance Benchmarks vs SciPy/NumPy

## Objective
Create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that benchmarks the performance of quactuary's extended distribution implementations against scipy/numpy baselines, demonstrating computational efficiency and identifying performance advantages.

## Detailed Description
Following the comprehensive testing implemented in T16, create a notebook that systematically benchmarks all extended distribution implementations against equivalent scipy/numpy implementations where available. The notebook should provide clear performance metrics, visualizations, and insights for users to understand when to use quactuary's implementations.

5. [x] Benchmark Edgeworth expansion vs normal approximations
6. [x] Include timing comparisons for PDF/CDF/PPF/RVS operations
7. [x] Add memory usage profiling where relevant
8. [x] Create performance visualization plots
9. [x] Document performance advantages and trade-offs
10. [x] Include recommendations for different use cases
