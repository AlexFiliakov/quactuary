# Task: Adaptive Optimization Strategies

## Description
Design and implement an intelligent optimization selection system that automatically chooses the most appropriate optimization strategy based on portfolio characteristics. Current testing reveals that QMC has setup overhead that makes it slower for smaller portfolios but beneficial for larger ones. This task will create an adaptive framework that optimizes performance across different portfolio sizes.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a portfolio analyzer that determines optimal optimization strategies based on size and complexity
- Implement automatic strategy selection logic in the PricingModel
- Establish performance thresholds for strategy switching
- Reduce overall simulation time by choosing appropriate optimizations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Portfolio analyzer correctly categorizes portfolios by size (small/medium/large)
- [ ] Strategy selector chooses optimal optimization combinations based on portfolio characteristics  
- [ ] Performance improves across all portfolio sizes compared to fixed strategies
- [ ] Integration tests pass with new adaptive strategy system
- [ ] Documentation explains strategy selection logic and tuning parameters

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze existing performance data to establish size thresholds
  - Review test results showing QMC overhead for medium portfolios
  - Determine breakeven points for different optimization strategies
- [ ] Design portfolio characteristic analyzer
  - Portfolio size (number of policies, simulations)
  - Portfolio complexity (heterogeneity, distribution types)
  - Available system resources (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Implement strategy selection logic
  - Small portfolios: Minimal optimization (avoid QMC overhead)
  - Medium portfolios: Selective optimization (JIT, vectorization)
  - Large portfolios: Full optimization (QMC, parallel, memory management)
- [ ] Create OptimizationConfig factory methods
  - get_optimal_config(portfolio_characteristics)
  - Support for manual override and testing modes
- [ ] Update PricingModel to use adaptive strategies
  - Backward compatibility with explicit optimization settings
  - Performance logging for strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Add configuration and tuning parameters
  - Threshold values for portfolio size categories
  - Strategy preference weights
  - Performance target multipliers
- [ ] Update integration tests to validate adaptive behavior
  - Test strategy selection for different portfolio sizes
  - Verify performance improvements over fixed strategies
- [ ] Create benchmarking suite to validate effectiveness
  - Compare adaptive vs fixed strategies across portfolio types
  - Document performance gains and trade-offs

## Notes
This task addresses findings from T013 where QMC setup overhead (1024 skip, scrambling) dominated performance for medium-sized portfolios, making them 30% slower than baseline. The adaptive system should eliminate this inefficiency while preserving benefits for larger portfolios.

Key considerations:
- QMC benefits emerge with larger sample sizes and portfolio complexity
- JIT compilation has one-time overhead but benefits repeated operations
- Parallel processing requires sufficient work to offset thread management costs
- Memory optimization becomes critical only for very large portfolios
