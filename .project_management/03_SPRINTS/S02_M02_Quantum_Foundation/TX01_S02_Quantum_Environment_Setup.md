# Task: Quantum Environment Setup

## Description
Set up the quantum computing environment by installing and configuring qiskit 1.4.2 and its dependencies. This is the foundational task that enables all subsequent quantum development work.

## Goal / Objectives
- Install qiskit 1.4.2 and verify installation
- Configure quantum simulation environment
- Set up development dependencies for quantum module
- Ensure compatibility with existing classical codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] qiskit 1.4.2 is installed and importable
- [x] Quantum simulators (Aer) are functional
- [x] All quantum dependencies are added to requirements.txt
- [x] Basic quantum circuit can be created and executed
- [x] No conflicts with existing dependencies

## Subtasks
- [x] Add qiskit==1.4.2 to requirements.txt
- [x] Install qiskit and verify installation
- [x] Create a simple test circuit to verify simulators work by implementing the working example `quactuary\examples\pilot_quantum_excess_evaluation_algorithm.ipynb` under the existing quActuary API using `from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator` only, no connection to IBM Quantum Cloud yet.
- [x] Thoroughly test the pilot implementation
- [x] Update setup.py with quantum dependencies
- [x] Document installation process in README.md

## Implementation Guidelines

### Qiskit 1.4.2 Installation
```bash
# Core installation
pip install qiskit==1.4.2
pip install qiskit-aer==0.15.1  # Simulators
pip install qiskit-visualization  # Optional: for circuit visualization
pip install qiskit-algorithms # For amplitude estimation

# Additional dependencies for actuarial applications
pip install scipy>=1.10.0  # For distributions
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For visualization
```

### Verification Script
Create `quactuary/quantum/verify_installation.py`:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Test basic circuit creation
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# Test simulation
backend = AerSimulator()
job = backend.run(qc, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(f"Bell state measurements: {counts}")
```

### Key Components from Excess Loss Example
- **StatePreparation**: For encoding probability distributions
- **AerSimulator**: Primary simulation backend
- **transpile**: For circuit optimization
