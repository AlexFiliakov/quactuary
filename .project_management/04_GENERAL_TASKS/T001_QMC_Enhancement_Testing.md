# Task: QMC Enhancement and Performance Testing

## Description
Complete the remaining enhancements and testing for the Sobol sequence QMC implementation. This task captures the work items that were not completed in T03_S01 but are valuable for production readiness.

## Goal / Objectives
- Measure and ensure 95% test coverage for QMC code
- Perform formal performance benchmarking to quantify convergence improvements
- Stress test with high-dimensional portfolios (1000+ dimensions)
- Complete documentation for optimal QMC usage
- Add convergence diagnostics to results

## Technical Requirements
- Test coverage measurement and reporting
- Performance benchmark suite comparing MC vs QMC
- High-dimensional stress tests
- Documentation of scrambling method selection
- Convergence diagnostic metrics in PricingResult

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage for sobol.py and qmc_wrapper.py exceeds 95%
- [ ] Formal benchmarks show 5-10x convergence improvement for tail measures
- [ ] Successfully handle portfolios with 1000+ dimensions
- [ ] Documentation includes scrambling method selection guide
- [ ] PricingResult includes QMC convergence diagnostics when applicable

## Subtasks

### 1. Test Coverage Measurement
- [ ] Run pytest with coverage for QMC modules
- [ ] Identify and add tests for uncovered branches
- [ ] Achieve 95% coverage target
- [ ] Document coverage results

### 2. Performance Benchmarking Suite
- [ ] Create benchmark script for MC vs QMC comparison
- [ ] Test convergence rates for different portfolio sizes
- [ ] Measure tail risk (VaR, TVaR) convergence specifically
- [ ] Quantify performance overhead of QMC setup
- [ ] Generate benchmark report with graphs

### 3. High-Dimensional Stress Testing
- [ ] Create test portfolios with 100, 500, 1000, 5000 policies
- [ ] Test dimension allocation strategy at scale
- [ ] Verify memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] Test dimension wrapping for very high claim counts
- [ ] Document performance characteristics vs dimension

### 4. Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] Write guide on when to use Owen scrambling vs other methods
- [ ] Document optimal skip values for different use cases
- [ ] Create best practices guide for QMC in actuarial applications
- [ ] Add examples of convergence diagnostic interpretation

### 5. Convergence Diagnostics
- [ ] Add convergence metrics to PricingResult metadata
- [ ] Implement effective sample size calculation
- [ ] Add variance reduction factor estimation
- [ ] Create visualization tools for sequence uniformity
- [ ] Update example notebook with diagnostic usage

### 6. Additional Optimizations
- [ ] Investigate multi-threaded Sobol generation
- [ ] Consider GPU acceleration options
- [ ] Optimize dimension allocation for correlation structures
- [ ] Profile and optimize wrapper overhead

## Implementation Notes
