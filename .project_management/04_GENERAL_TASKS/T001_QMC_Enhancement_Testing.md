# Task: QMC Enhancement and Performance Testing

## Description
Complete the remaining enhancements and testing for the Sobol sequence QMC implementation. This task captures the work items that were not completed in T03_S01 but are valuable for production readiness.

## Goal / Objectives
- Measure and ensure 95% test coverage for QMC code
- Perform formal performance benchmarking to quantify convergence improvements
- Stress test with high-dimensional portfolios (1000+ dimensions)
- Complete documentation for optimal QMC usage
- Add convergence diagnostics to results

## Technical Requirements
- Test coverage measurement and reporting
- Performance benchmark suite comparing MC vs QMC
- High-dimensional stress tests
- Documentation of scrambling method selection
- Convergence diagnostic metrics in PricingResult

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage for sobol.py and qmc_wrapper.py exceeds 95%
- [ ] Formal benchmarks show 5-10x convergence improvement for tail measures
- [ ] Successfully handle portfolios with 1000+ dimensions
- [ ] Documentation includes scrambling method selection guide
- [ ] PricingResult includes QMC convergence diagnostics when applicable
