# Task: run_dev.py Enhancements

## Description
Complete the remaining optional enhancements for the run_dev.py development script that were identified but not implemented in T09_S01. These are quality-of-life improvements that would enhance the developer experience but are not critical for core functionality.

## Goal / Objectives
Add the remaining optional features to run_dev.py to provide a complete development environment management solution.
- Add utility commands for development workflow
- Improve user experience with progress indicators
- Add developer convenience features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile command implemented for performance profiling
- [ ] Setup command implemented for initial environment setup
- [ ] Version command implemented for package information display
- [ ] Progress indicators added for long-running commands
- [ ] Tab completion support investigated and documented
- [ ] IDE integration documentation added to development docs

## Subtasks

### Add Utility Commands
- [ ] Implement profile command for performance profiling:
  ```python
  def run_profile(args):
      """Run performance profiling on specified module/function."""
      # Use cProfile or line_profiler for profiling
  ```
- [ ] Implement setup command for initial environment setup:
  ```python
  def setup_environment(args):
      """Set up initial development environment from scratch."""
      # Check Python version, create venv, install deps, etc.
  ```
- [ ] Implement version command for package information:
  ```python
  def show_version(args):
      """Display package version and environment info."""
      # Show quactuary version, Python version, dependencies
  ```

### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running commands (test, coverage, docs)
- [ ] Research and document tab completion setup for bash/zsh
- [ ] Add section to development documentation for IDE integration patterns

### Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Test all new commands work correctly
- [ ] Update README.md with new command documentation
- [ ] Add examples for new workflows
