# Task: Configuration and Environment Testing Matrix

## Description
Create comprehensive testing matrix for different configuration combinations and deployment environments including cloud platforms, container deployments, resource constraints, and Python ecosystem compatibility to ensure the optimization framework works across diverse environments.

## Goal / Objectives
- Test all configuration combinations
- Validate deployment across different environments
- Ensure resource constraint handling
- Verify Python ecosystem compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-environment testing setup
- Container orchestration knowledge
- Cloud platform familiarity
- Resource constraint simulation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All configuration combinations tested
- [ ] Cloud deployments validated (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Container deployments working
- [ ] Resource constraints handled gracefully
- [ ] Python version compatibility confirmed

## Subtasks

### 1. Configuration Combination Testing
- [ ] Create test matrix configuration:
  ```yaml
  configurations:
    - name: "minimal"
      jit: false
      parallel: false
      memory_limit: "1GB"
    - name: "balanced"
      jit: true
      parallel: true
      memory_limit: "4GB"
    - name: "performance"
      all_optimizations: true
      memory_limit: "16GB"
  ```

### 2. Hardware Configuration Testing
- [ ] Cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Container limitations (Docker, K8s)
- [ ] Laptop specs (4-8 cores, 8-16GB RAM)
- [ ] Server specs (32+ cores, 64GB+ RAM)
- [ ] GPU availability testing (future)

### 3. Resource-Constrained Testing
- [ ] Memory limits: 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB
- [ ] CPU limits: 1, 2, 4, 8 cores
- [ ] Disk I/O constraints
- [ ] Network bandwidth limits (distributed)

### 4. Python Ecosystem Testing
- [ ] Python versions: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- [ ] NumPy versions: 1.20+
- [ ] Numba compatibility matrix
- [ ] Platform differences (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### 5. Deployment Environment Testing
- [ ] Jupyter notebook integration
- [ ] Web service deployment (FastAPI, Flask)
- [ ] Batch processing systems
- [ ] Containerized deployments
- [ ] Serverless functions (Lambda constraints)
