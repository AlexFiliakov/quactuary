# Task: QMC Performance Optimization and Coverage Completion

## Description
This task captures the remaining work extracted from T001_QMC_Enhancement_Testing. These are the final optimization and coverage items needed to complete the QMC enhancement work that originated from the Sobol sequences sprint task.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve 95% test coverage target for QMC modules
- Profile and optimize wrapper overhead to reduce performance impact

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage for sobol.py and qmc_wrapper.py exceeds 95%
- [ ] Wrapper overhead is profiled and optimized where possible
- [ ] Performance improvements are documented and quantified

## Subtasks
- [ ] Achieve 95% coverage target (from Test Coverage Measurement in T001)
- [ ] Profile and optimize wrapper overhead (from Additional Optimizations in T001)
