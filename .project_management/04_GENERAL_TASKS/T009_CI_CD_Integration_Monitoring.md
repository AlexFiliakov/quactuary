# Task: Continuous Integration and Monitoring Setup

## Description
Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for integration tests with automated performance monitoring, regression detection, and reporting infrastructure to ensure ongoing quality and performance of the optimization framework.

## Goal / Objectives
- Automate integration test execution
- Implement performance monitoring
- Enable regression detection
- Create comprehensive reporting

## Technical Requirements
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Monitoring infrastructure setup
- Automated reporting tools
- Performance tracking database

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs integration tests automatically
- [ ] Performance metrics collected and tracked
- [ ] Regression alerts configured
- [ ] Test results dashboard available
- [ ] Historical trend analysis working

## Subtasks

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- [ ] Configure integration test workflow:
  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/integration-tests.yml
  - run on schedule (nightly)
  - run on PR to main
  - performance regression alerts
  - test result dashboards
  ```

### 2. Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
