# Task: Complete Distribution API Implementation

## Description
Complete the implementation of missing distribution classes and methods that were identified during T009. This includes implementing missing mixed Poisson classes, completing placeholder methods in zero-inflated distributions, and fixing remaining test failures.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement all missing distribution classes
- Complete placeholder methods with proper implementations
- Fix numerical accuracy issues in distribution tests
- Ensure all distribution tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PoissonInverseGaussianMixture class implemented in mixed_poisson.py
- [ ] HierarchicalPoissonMixture class implemented in mixed_poisson.py
- [ ] ZeroInflatedMixtureEM methods implemented (_e_step, _m_step, _compute_log_likelihood)
- [ ] Edgeworth expansion tests fully passing (8 remaining failures fixed)
- [ ] Mixed Poisson tests fully passing (18 remaining failures fixed)
- [ ] Zero-inflated tests fully passing (all 16 tests)
- [ ] Compound binomial tests fully passing (4 remaining failures fixed)
- [ ] No regression in previously passing tests
