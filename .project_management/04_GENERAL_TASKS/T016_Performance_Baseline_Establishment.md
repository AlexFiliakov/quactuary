# Task: Establish Performance Testing Baseline Infrastructure

## Description
Many integration tests were marked as deprecated because they rely on stable baseline data or make hardware-specific performance assumptions. We need to establish a proper performance testing infrastructure that can adapt to different environments while still detecting regressions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create adaptive performance baseline system
- Implement environment-aware performance testing
- Establish continuous performance monitoring
- Enable meaningful regression detection across environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance baseline system is implemented
- [ ] Tests adapt to local hardware capabilities
- [ ] Regression detection works across different environments
- [ ] Performance trends can be tracked over time
- [ ] Clear reporting of performance metrics

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design adaptive baseline system
  - Create baseline data structure that includes environment info
  - Design algorithm for adjusting expectations based on hardware
  - Implement statistical methods for comparing across environments
  - Plan for baseline data storage and versioning
- [ ] Implement hardware profiling
  - Create hardware capability detection module
  - Profile CPU, memory, and I/O characteristics
  - Generate hardware performance score
  - Store hardware profile with test results
- [ ] Create performance test framework
  - Build on existing PerformanceBenchmark class
  - Add environment normalization features
  - Implement relative performance metrics
  - Create performance regression detection algorithm
- [ ] Develop baseline management tools
  - Create CLI tool for baseline management
  - Implement baseline update mechanism
  - Add baseline comparison and reporting
  - Create visualization for performance trends
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD
  - Set up performance test runs in CI
  - Configure baseline updates on releases
  - Create performance regression alerts
  - Generate performance reports for PRs
- [ ] Document performance testing approach
  - Write guide for performance test development
  - Document baseline management procedures
  - Create troubleshooting guide for performance issues
  - Provide examples of good performance tests

## Notes
This infrastructure is crucial for maintaining performance standards without creating brittle tests. The system should be flexible enough to work on developer laptops as well as CI servers while still providing meaningful performance insights.
