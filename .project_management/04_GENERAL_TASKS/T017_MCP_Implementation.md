# Task: Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) Implementation for quactuary

## Description

Implement a comprehensive Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server for the quactuary package to enable Claude Code to easily access and use quactuary functions for feature development, testing, and benchmarking via Jupyter Notebooks. The existing MCP sketch in `/quactuary/mcp/` provides a foundation but requires substantial development to create a functional MCP interface.

MCP will allow Claude Code to:
- Execute actuarial calculations and simulations
- Access distribution classes and methods
- Perform portfolio analysis and pricing
- Run benchmarks and performance tests
- Generate data for analysis and visualization

## Goal / Objectives

- Create a fully functional MCP server that exposes key quactuary functionality
- Provide comprehensive tool coverage for pricing, distributions, and portfolio analysis
- Implement proper resource management for data access
- Enable seamless integration with Claude Code workflows
- Establish testing infrastructure for MCP components
- Document MCP capabilities and usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server starts successfully and accepts connections
- [ ] All core quactuary functions are accessible via MCP tools
- [ ] MCP tools handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful responses
- [ ] Resource system provides access to data formats and schemas
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite validates all MCP functionality
