# Task: Consolidate Compound Distributions

## Description
Consolidate compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a single unified module to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability. This task was migrated from sprint S01_M01_Classical_Optimization to general tasks.

## Goal / Objectives
- Merge compound.py and compound_extensions.py into a single cohesive module
- Eliminate code duplication between the two files
- Improve maintainability by having a single source of truth for compound distributions
- Ensure all tests continue to pass after consolidation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All functionality from compound_extensions.py is integrated into compound.py
- [ ] compound_extensions.py is removed from the codebase
- [ ] All imports are updated to reference the consolidated module
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Code coverage remains at or above 90%
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the consolidation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze both files to identify duplicate code and unique functionality
- [ ] Create a plan for merging without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Move unique functionality from compound_extensions.py to compound.py
- [ ] Update all imports throughout the codebase
- [ ] Remove compound_extensions.py
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Update documentation and docstrings
