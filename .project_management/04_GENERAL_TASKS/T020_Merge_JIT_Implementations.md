# Task: Merge JIT Implementations

## Description
Merge JIT-compiled versions (classical_jit.py, sobol_optimized.py) into their base modules using feature flags instead of separate files. This task was migrated from sprint S01_M01_Classical_Optimization to general tasks.

## Goal / Objectives
- Consolidate JIT implementations into their respective base modules
- Implement feature flags to control JIT compilation
- Simplify the codebase by reducing the number of files
- Maintain performance optimizations while improving code organization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] classical_jit.py functionality is merged into classical.py with feature flags
- [ ] sobol_optimized.py functionality is merged into sobol.py with feature flags
- [ ] JIT compilation can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [ ] Performance remains equivalent when JIT is enabled
- [ ] All tests pass with both JIT enabled and disabled
- [ ] Old JIT files are removed from the codebase

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design feature flag system for enabling/disabling JIT compilation
- [ ] Merge classical_jit.py into classical.py with conditional JIT decorators
- [ ] Merge sobol_optimized.py into sobol.py with conditional JIT decorators
- [ ] Update all imports to use the consolidated modules
- [ ] Test performance with JIT enabled vs disabled
- [ ] Remove obsolete JIT files
- [ ] Update documentation to explain JIT configuration
