# Task: Adaptive Optimization Strategies

## Description
Design and implement intelligent optimization selection system that automatically chooses appropriate strategies based on portfolio characteristics to address QMC overhead issues for medium-sized portfolios. This task was migrated from sprint S01_M01_Classical_Optimization to general tasks.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create an intelligent system that analyzes portfolio characteristics
- Automatically select optimal computation strategies (MC vs QMC, JIT vs standard)
- Address performance issues with QMC for medium-sized portfolios
- Provide configuration options for manual override when needed
- Ensure consistent performance improvements across different portfolio sizes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimization selector analyzes portfolio size, complexity, and distribution types
- [ ] System automatically chooses between MC/QMC based on expected performance
- [ ] JIT compilation is enabled/disabled based on problem characteristics
- [ ] Performance improves for medium-sized portfolios (100-1000 policies)
- [ ] Manual override configuration is available
- [ ] Decision logic is well-documented and testable
- [ ] Benchmarks show consistent improvements

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research optimal thresholds for MC vs QMC selection
- [ ] Design portfolio characteristic analysis system
- [ ] Implement decision logic for optimization selection
- [ ] Create configuration system for manual overrides
- [ ] Integrate with existing PricingModel and simulation code
- [ ] Benchmark performance across various portfolio sizes
- [ ] Document decision criteria and usage patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for the selection logic
