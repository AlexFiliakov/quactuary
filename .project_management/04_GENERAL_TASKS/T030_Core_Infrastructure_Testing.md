# Task: Core Infrastructure Unit Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for core infrastructure modules to achieve 95%+ test coverage. These modules form the foundation of the quactuary package and currently have no test coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
Achieve comprehensive test coverage for core infrastructure modules:
- Test type definitions and validation in _typing.py
- Test data structure operations in datatypes.py  
- Test JIT compilation correctness in jit_kernels.py and classical_jit.py
- Ensure all edge cases and error conditions are covered

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ statement coverage for all targeted modules
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Tests are well-documented and maintainable
- [ ] Performance tests included for JIT-compiled functions
- [ ] Type validation tests cover all custom types

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test_typing.py for _typing.py module
  - [ ] Test all type aliases and custom types
  - [ ] Test type validation functions if any
  - [ ] Test type conversion utilities
- [ ] Create test_datatypes.py for datatypes.py module
  - [ ] Test all data structure classes
  - [ ] Test initialization and validation
  - [ ] Test serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Create test_jit_kernels.py for jit_kernels.py module
  - [ ] Test all JIT-compiled functions
  - [ ] Test numerical accuracy
  - [ ] Test performance improvements
  - [ ] Test edge cases (empty arrays, single values, etc.)
- [ ] Create test_classical_jit.py for classical_jit.py module
  - [ ] Test classical simulation functions
  - [ ] Test JIT compilation behavior
  - [ ] Test numerical stability
  - [ ] Test large-scale simulations
