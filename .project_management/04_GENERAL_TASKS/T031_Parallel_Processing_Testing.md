# Task: Parallel Processing and Performance Unit Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for parallel processing, performance, and work distribution modules. These modules are critical for system performance but currently lack test coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
Achieve comprehensive test coverage for parallel processing infrastructure:
- Test work distribution algorithms and edge cases
- Test parallel utility functions and error handling
- Test performance baseline management
- Test performance testing framework itself

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ statement coverage for all targeted modules
- [ ] Tests validate thread safety and race conditions
- [ ] Error handling tests cover all exception paths
- [ ] Performance regression tests included
- [ ] Tests run successfully in parallel environments

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test_work_distribution.py for work_distribution.py
  - [ ] Test work partitioning algorithms
  - [ ] Test load balancing logic
  - [ ] Test edge cases (single item, uneven distribution)
  - [ ] Test performance under different workloads
- [ ] Create test_parallel_utils.py for parallel_utils.py
  - [ ] Test parallel execution utilities
  - [ ] Test thread pool management
  - [ ] Test synchronization mechanisms
  - [ ] Test resource cleanup
- [ ] Create test_parallel_error_handling.py for parallel_error_handling.py
  - [ ] Test all custom exception classes
  - [ ] Test error propagation in parallel contexts
  - [ ] Test error aggregation and reporting
  - [ ] Test recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Create test_performance_baseline.py for performance_baseline.py
  - [ ] Test baseline calculation logic
  - [ ] Test hardware normalization
  - [ ] Test baseline persistence and loading
  - [ ] Test adaptive baseline updates
- [ ] Create test_performance_testing.py for performance_testing.py
  - [ ] Test performance measurement utilities
  - [ ] Test benchmarking framework
  - [ ] Test performance reporting
  - [ ] Test regression detection
