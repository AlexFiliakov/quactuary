# Task: Pricing Strategies Unit Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for the pricing_strategies.py module. This module implements various pricing calculation strategies and is critical for actuarial computations but currently has no test coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
Achieve comprehensive test coverage for all pricing strategies:
- Test each pricing strategy implementation
- Validate numerical accuracy of calculations
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure strategies integrate properly with main pricing module

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ statement coverage for pricing_strategies.py
- [ ] Tests validate mathematical correctness
- [ ] Tests cover all supported pricing methods
- [ ] Integration tests with pricing.py module
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for each strategy

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test_pricing_strategies.py
  - [ ] Test base pricing strategy interface
  - [ ] Test pure premium calculation strategies
  - [ ] Test loaded premium strategies
  - [ ] Test risk-adjusted pricing strategies
  - [ ] Test credibility-based pricing strategies
- [ ] Test edge cases
  - [ ] Zero claims scenarios
  - [ ] Extreme loss scenarios
  - [ ] Invalid parameter handling
  - [ ] Numerical overflow/underflow protection
- [ ] Integration testing
  - [ ] Test strategy selection logic
  - [ ] Test strategy composition
  - [ ] Test fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] Test caching and memoization
- [ ] Performance testing
  - [ ] Benchmark each strategy
  - [ ] Test scalability with large portfolios
  - [ ] Memory usage profiling
  - [ ] Optimization opportunities
