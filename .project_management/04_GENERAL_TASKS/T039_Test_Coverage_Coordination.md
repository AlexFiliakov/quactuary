# Task: Test Coverage Coordination and Integration

## Description
Coordinate the overall effort to achieve 95%+ test coverage across the quactuary package. This task manages dependencies between other testing tasks and ensures comprehensive coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
Coordinate and integrate all testing efforts:
- Track overall test coverage progress
- Manage dependencies between test modules
- Ensure consistent testing patterns
- Achieve and maintain 95%+ coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Overall test coverage ≥ 95%
- [ ] All modules have corresponding test files
- [ ] Test documentation is complete
- [ ] CI/CD integration is working
- [ ] Coverage reports are automated

## Subtasks
- [ ] Set up coverage tracking infrastructure
  - [ ] Configure coverage.py settings
  - [ ] Set up coverage reporting
  - [ ] Create coverage dashboards
  - [ ] Integrate with CI/CD
- [ ] Coordinate test implementation
  - [ ] Track T030-T035 progress (new tests)
  - [ ] Track T036-T038 progress (fixes)
  - [ ] Identify coverage gaps
  - [ ] Prioritize remaining work
- [ ] Establish testing standards
  - [ ] Create test naming conventions
  - [ ] Document testing patterns
  - [ ] Create test data generators
  - [ ] Establish mock/stub guidelines
- [ ] Integration and validation
  - [ ] Run full test suite
  - [ ] Validate coverage metrics
  - [ ] Performance profiling
  - [ ] Documentation review
