# Task: run_dev.py Enhancements

## Description
Complete the remaining optional enhancements for the run_dev.py development script that were identified but not implemented in T09_S01. These are quality-of-life improvements that would enhance the developer experience but are not critical for core functionality.

## Goal / Objectives
Add the remaining optional features to run_dev.py to provide a complete development environment management solution.
- Add utility commands for development workflow
- Improve user experience with progress indicators
- Add developer convenience features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Profile command implemented for performance profiling
- [x] Setup command implemented for initial environment setup
- [x] Version command implemented for package information display
- [x] Progress indicators added for long-running commands
- [x] Tab completion support investigated and documented
- [x] IDE integration documentation added to development docs

## Subtasks

### Add Utility Commands
- [x] Implement profile command for performance profiling:
  ```python
  def run_profile(args):
      """Run performance profiling on specified module/function."""
      # Use cProfile or line_profiler for profiling
  ```
- [x] Implement setup command for initial environment setup:
  ```python
  def setup_environment(args):
      """Set up initial development environment from scratch."""
      # Check Python version, create venv, install deps, etc.
  ```
- [x] Implement version command for package information:
  ```python
  def show_version(args):
      """Display package version and environment info."""
      # Show quactuary version, Python version, dependencies
  ```

### User Experience Enhancements
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running commands (test, coverage, docs)
- [x] Research and document tab completion setup for bash/zsh
- [x] Add section to development documentation for IDE integration patterns

### Testing and Documentation
- [x] Test all new commands work correctly
- [x] Update README.md with new command documentation
- [x] Add examples for new workflows
