# Task: Fix test_parameter_boundaries Failure

## Description
Fix the single failing test in test_parameter_boundaries. This is a quick win that will help understand the failure patterns in the test suite and provide immediate value by reducing the failure count.

## Goal / Objectives
- Investigate and fix the test_parameter_boundaries failure
- Understand the root cause of the failure
- Document the fix pattern for similar issues
- Ensure the fix doesn't break other tests

## Technical Requirements
- Debug the specific test failure
- Identify if it's a test issue or code issue
- Apply minimal fix to resolve the failure
- Run related tests to ensure no regression

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] test_parameter_boundaries passes successfully
- [x] Root cause is documented
- [x] No regression in other tests
- [x] Fix pattern is documented for similar issues

## Subtasks

### 1. Investigation
- [x] Run the specific test in isolation
- [x] Capture the exact error message and stack trace
- [x] Identify the failing assertion or exception
- [x] Determine if it's a test bug or code bug

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- [x] Analyze the expected vs actual behavior
- [x] Check if recent changes caused the failure
- [x] Verify test assumptions are still valid
- [x] Document the root cause

### 3. Implementation
- [x] Apply the minimal fix needed
- [x] Update test if needed (only if test is incorrect)
- [x] Update code if needed (only if code is incorrect)
- [x] Add comments explaining the fix

### 4. Verification
- [x] Run the fixed test multiple times
- [x] Run related tests in the same module
- [x] Check for any performance impact
- [x] Ensure fix aligns with project standards

## Implementation Notes
- This is a quick win task that should be completed first
- The fix pattern may help with other failing tests
- Focus on minimal changes to resolve the issue
- Document learnings for the team

## References
- Test file: Location to be determined during investigation
- Related modules: To be identified during investigation

## Output Log
### 2025-05-25 20:00 - Task Created
- Created as part of parallel test fixing strategy
- Identified as quick win for immediate progress
- Status: Ready for implementation

### 2025-05-25 23:21 - Task Started
- Status changed to in_progress
- Beginning investigation of test_parameter_boundaries failure

### 2025-05-25 23:26 - Investigation Complete
- Found test in test_extended_distributions.py
- Ran test in isolation and captured error
- Root cause: Test was accessing internal _dist attribute instead of using public API
- Secondary issue: PoissonGammaMixture not validating parameters

### 2025-05-25 23:29 - Implementation Complete
- Fixed test to use known parameter values instead of accessing _dist
- Added parameter validation call to PoissonGammaMixture.__init__
- Test now passes successfully
- Fix pattern: Avoid accessing internal implementation details in tests

### 2025-05-25 23:31 - Verification Complete
- All 16 tests in test_extended_distributions.py pass
- No performance regression observed
- Fix aligns with project standards
- Root cause documented for future reference

### 2025-05-25 23:50 - Task Completed
