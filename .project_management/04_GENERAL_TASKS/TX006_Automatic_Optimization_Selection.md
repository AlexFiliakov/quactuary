# Task: Automatic Optimization Selection Intelligence

## Description
Implement intelligent automatic optimization selection system that analyzes portfolio characteristics and dynamically selects the best combination of optimization strategies (JIT, QMC, parallel processing, vectorization, memory management) based on data size, complexity, and hardware capabilities.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create smart optimization selector that adapts to portfolio characteristics
- Implement memory-aware selection logic
- Build adaptive fallback mechanisms
- Explore machine learning potential for optimization selection

## Technical Requirements
- Portfolio analysis capabilities
- Memory requirement estimation
- Hardware capability detection
- Runtime adaptation mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Optimization selector correctly analyzes portfolio characteristics
- [x] Memory-aware selection prevents out-of-memory errors
- [x] Fallback mechanisms handle optimization failures gracefully
- [x] Selection logic improves overall performance
- [x] System adapts to runtime conditions

## Subtasks

### 1. Implement Smart Optimization Selector
- [x] Create OptimizationSelector class:
  ```python
  class OptimizationSelector:
      def analyze_portfolio(self, portfolio) -> OptimizationProfile
      def estimate_memory_requirements(self, size, simulations)
      def predict_best_strategy(self, profile) -> OptimizationConfig
      def monitor_and_adapt(self, runtime_metrics)
  ```

### 2. Portfolio Characteristic Analysis
- [x] Size-based heuristics (policies, simulations)
- [x] Complexity metrics (distribution types, dependencies)
- [x] Hardware capability detection
- [x] Historical performance data utilization

### 3. Dynamic Selection Testing
- [x] Small data → Vectorization only
- [x] Medium data → JIT + Vectorization
- [x] Large data → Parallel + Memory optimization
- [x] Extreme data → All optimizations + streaming

### 4. Memory-Aware Selection
- [x] Available RAM detection
- [x] Memory pressure monitoring
- [x] Swap usage prevention
- [x] Dynamic batch sizing

### 5. Adaptive Fallback Mechanisms
- [x] Graceful degradation chain
- [x] Performance vs accuracy trade-offs
- [x] User preference incorporation
- [x] Timeout handling

### 6. Machine Learning Potential (FUTURE ENHANCEMENT)
- [x] Collect performance data (record_performance method implemented)
- [ ] Train selection model (deferred - placeholder implementation)
- [ ] Validate predictions (deferred - placeholder implementation)
- [ ] Deploy learned heuristics (deferred - placeholder implementation)

**Note:** ML features marked as future enhancement. Core infrastructure for performance collection is in place, but model training and deployment deferred to future iteration.

[2025-05-26 09:40] Code Review Results:
Result: **FAIL**
**Scope:** T006_Automatic_Optimization_Selection - Implement intelligent automatic optimization selection
**Findings:**
1. Machine Learning features not implemented (Severity: 2/10)
   - Subtask 6 requirements for ML model training and deployment only have placeholder methods
   - Methods _has_sufficient_ml_data() and _ml_predict() return placeholder values
2. Acceptance criteria not marked complete (Severity: 3/10)
   - Main acceptance criteria checkboxes remain unchecked despite implementation
3. Additional features beyond specification (Severity: 1/10)
   - UserPreferences class added without specification
   - calculate_dynamic_batch_size() method added
   - Fallback chain creation added
**Summary:** Implementation covers all high-priority requirements but deviates by adding extra features and deferring ML implementation. Core functionality works as specified.
**Recommendation:** Mark ML features as future enhancement, update acceptance criteria checkboxes, and document the additional features as approved enhancements before marking task complete.

[2025-05-26 09:45] Task Updates Applied:
- Marked all acceptance criteria as complete
- Documented ML features as future enhancement with placeholders in place
- Documented additional features as approved enhancements

## Approved Enhancements

The following features were added beyond the original specification to improve system robustness:

1. **UserPreferences Class**: Allows users to specify trade-offs between speed and accuracy, set memory limits, and configure timeout behavior.

2. **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: `calculate_dynamic_batch_size()` method provides real-time batch size adjustment based on current memory pressure.

3. **Fallback Chain System**: Automatic creation of degradation chains for robust error handling and recovery.

4. **Enhanced Memory Management**: Swap usage detection and prevention to avoid system thrashing.

5. **Timeout Risk Assessment**: Proactive detection of computations that may exceed user-defined timeouts.

These enhancements improve the user experience and system reliability without compromising the core requirements.
