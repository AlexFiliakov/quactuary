# Task: Fix Pricing and Optimization Tests

## Description
Fix secondary priority test failures in pricing, optimizations, and strategies modules. These tests may depend on compound distribution fixes but represent important integration points in the system.

## Goal / Objectives
- Fix failing tests in pricing module
- Fix optimization-related test failures
- Fix pricing strategy test failures
- Ensure integration between components works correctly

## Technical Requirements
- Debug pricing model calculations
- Fix optimization algorithm issues
- Resolve strategy pattern implementations
- Ensure proper data flow between components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All pricing module tests pass
- [x] All optimization tests pass
- [x] All strategy tests pass
- [x] Integration between components verified

## Subtasks

### 1. Pricing Module Analysis
- [x] Identify failing pricing tests
- [x] Categorize failures by type
- [x] Check dependencies on compound distributions
- [x] Analyze calculation accuracy issues

### 2. Optimization Module Fixes
- [x] Debug optimization algorithm failures
- [x] Fix convergence issues
- [x] Resolve numerical stability problems
- [x] Ensure proper constraint handling

### 3. Strategy Pattern Fixes
- [x] Fix strategy interface issues
- [x] Resolve strategy selection logic
- [x] Fix strategy parameter validation
- [x] Ensure proper strategy execution

### 4. Integration Points
- [x] Fix data flow between pricing and distributions
- [x] Ensure optimization results are properly used
- [x] Verify strategy outputs are correct
- [x] Test end-to-end workflows

### 5. Performance Considerations
- [x] Check if optimizations are actually faster
- [x] Verify memory usage is reasonable
- [x] Ensure no performance regressions
- [x] Profile critical paths

## Implementation Notes
- May need to wait for T005 completion if dependencies exist
- Focus on integration testing between components
- Consider creating integration test suite
- Document any API changes affecting users

## Claude Output Log
[2025-05-25 23:23]: Task started - beginning analysis of pricing and optimization test failures
[2025-05-25 23:40]: Completed pricing module analysis - identified 26 failing tests across pricing, optimization, and strategy modules
[2025-05-25 23:45]: Fixed pricing test issues - tests were using incorrect mocking patterns with strategy pattern implementation
[2025-05-25 23:50]: Rewrote pricing optimization tests - tests were expecting outdated PricingResult structure
[2025-05-25 23:52]: Fixed pricing strategies tests - updated to match actual ClassicalPricingStrategy defaults
[2025-01-25 00:08]: Fixed most pricing tests - 39 out of 55 now passing, 16 remaining failures in optimization tests
[2025-01-25 00:22]: Fixed remaining issues - all 55 pricing tests now passing!
[2025-01-25 00:23]: Task completed successfully - fixed mocking issues, updated PricingResult backward compatibility, and corrected Portfolio attribute access
