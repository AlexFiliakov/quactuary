# Task: Fix Memory Management and Performance Test Failures

## Description
Fix failing tests related to memory management, vectorized simulation, and performance benchmarks. These tests are failing due to API changes in the memory management system and vectorized simulation interfaces. Many tests expect classes and methods that may have been refactored or removed.

## Goal / Objectives
- Update memory management tests to match current implementation
- Fix vectorized simulation tests for new API
- Update or remove obsolete performance benchmark tests
- Ensure memory efficiency tests reflect realistic expectations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All memory management tests pass (test_memory_management.py)
- [x] All vectorized simulation tests pass (test_vectorized_simulation.py)
- [x] Performance validation tests either pass or are marked appropriately
- [x] No memory leaks in updated tests
- [x] Clear documentation of any removed functionality

## Subtasks
- [x] Fix MemoryConfig and MemoryManager tests
  - Update test_memory_config_defaults and test_memory_config_custom
  - Fix initialization tests for MemoryManager
  - Update memory estimation and allocation tests
- [x] Fix StreamingSimulator tests
  - Update initialization and simulation tests
  - Fix online statistics update tests
  - Handle empty portfolio edge case
- [x] Fix VectorizedSimulator tests
  - Update simulate_inforce_vectorized tests (v1 and v2)
  - Fix consistency tests between versions
  - Update apply_policy_terms_vectorized tests
- [x] Update performance benchmark tests
  - Fix or remove TestBenchmarkResult and TestPerformanceBenchmark (tests don't exist - no action needed)
  - Update speedup validation tests with realistic targets (not found)
  - Fix memory usage limit tests (not found)
- [x] Fix QMC convergence tests
  - Update convergence rate expectations
  - Fix tail convergence tests
  - Update QMC wrapper coverage tests
