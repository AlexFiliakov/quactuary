# Task: Fix Integration and End-to-End Test Failures

## Description
Fix failing integration tests that validate end-to-end scenarios, accuracy validation, and optimization combinations. These tests are critical for ensuring the system works correctly as a whole. Many failures are due to changes in the pricing model API, portfolio construction, and optimization strategy interfaces.

## Goal / Objectives
- Fix all integration test failures while maintaining test coverage
- Update tests to reflect current API and architectural decisions
- Ensure end-to-end scenarios accurately represent real-world usage
- Validate that optimization combinations work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All end-to-end scenario tests pass
- [x] Accuracy validation tests pass with appropriate tolerances
- [x] Optimization combination tests work correctly
- [x] Performance validation tests have realistic expectations
- [x] Integration tests provide meaningful validation

## Subtasks
- [x] Fix portfolio generation in conftest.py
  - Remove 'location' parameter from Lognormal initialization
  - Update generate_deterministic_portfolio function
  - Fix fixture dependencies (small_portfolio, medium_portfolio, etc.)
- [x] Fix end-to-end scenario tests
  - Update test_homogeneous_small_portfolio for new API
  - Fix heterogeneous portfolio tests
  - Update memory management tests for large portfolios
  - Fix parallel scaling validation
- [x] Fix accuracy validation tests
  - Update numerical accuracy tests
  - Fix moments preservation tests
  - Update distribution shape preservation
  - Fix correlation structure preservation
- [x] Fix optimization combination tests
  - Handle missing optimization strategy classes
  - Update single optimization strategy tests
  - Fix binary and triple optimization combinations
  - Update fallback mechanism tests
- [x] Fix performance validation tests
  - Update speedup targets to realistic values
  - Fix memory usage limit expectations
  - Update QMC convergence rate tests
  - Fix baseline comparison tests
- [x] Fix risk measure tests
  - Update VaR calculation tests
  - Fix monotonicity tests
  - Handle confidence level edge cases
