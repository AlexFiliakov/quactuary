# Task: Integration Test Architecture Review and Refactoring

## Description
The integration test suite has shown several architectural issues including hardware-dependent tests, overly strict statistical tests, and tests that are too sensitive to implementation details. A comprehensive review and refactoring is needed to create a more maintainable and reliable test suite.

## Goal / Objectives
- Review and categorize all integration tests by purpose and dependencies
- Identify and refactor problematic test patterns
- Create clear test categories with appropriate markers
- Establish guidelines for future test development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All tests are properly categorized and marked
- [x] Hardware-dependent tests are isolated or made configurable
- [x] Statistical tests use appropriate methods and tolerances
- [x] Test suite runs reliably across different environments
- [x] Clear documentation of test architecture decisions

## Subtasks
- [x] Categorize existing integration tests
  - Create matrix of test types vs dependencies
  - Identify hardware-dependent tests (CPU count, memory, performance)
  - Mark tests that require specific environments
  - Document test purposes and what they validate
- [x] Refactor hardware-dependent tests
  - Create @pytest.mark.hardware_dependent marker
  - Make performance expectations configurable via environment variables
  - Use pytest.skip with clear reasons for unavailable hardware
  - Consider using mock/stub for hardware-specific features
- [x] Review statistical test methods
  - Audit all tests using statistical comparisons
  - Replace overly strict tests with appropriate statistical methods
  - Use confidence intervals instead of hard thresholds
  - Consider multiple test runs for stochastic validation
- [x] Create test environment profiles
  - Define minimal, standard, and performance test profiles
  - Create pytest configuration for each profile
  - Document hardware requirements for each profile
  - Implement automatic profile detection
- [x] Establish test design patterns
  - Create templates for common test scenarios
  - Document when to use integration vs unit tests
  - Define appropriate use of mocks and fixtures
  - Create guidelines for performance testing
- [x] Implement test stability improvements
  - Add retry logic for flaky tests with @pytest.mark.flaky
  - Use fixed seeds for reproducible stochastic tests
  - Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
  - Add diagnostic output for test failures

## Notes
This architectural review is essential for long-term maintainability. Many current test failures are due to architectural issues rather than actual bugs in the code. The goal is to create a test suite that provides confidence without being brittle.
