# Architecture Review Retrospective - 2025-05-26

## Sprint Context
**Review Type:** Full Architecture Review  
**Sprint:** Pre-Sprint (No formal sprint structure exists)  
**Review Result:** NEEDS_WORK - Overengineered but Promising

## Key Observations

### What We Discovered

1. **The Quantum Gap**
   - Core value proposition (quantum algorithms) is completely missing
   - Built extensive infrastructure for switching between classical/quantum backends
   - But quantum backend is just a placeholder
   - Like building a garage before buying the car

2. **Architecture Complexity**
   - 956-line memory management system for basic batch calculations
   - 5+ abstraction layers between user and Monte Carlo simulation
   - Strategy pattern implemented before having multiple strategies
   - Classic case of YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) violation

3. **Performance Contradictions**
   - JIT compilation applied to sequential loops (fighting Python's GIL)
   - Memory "optimization" that kills numpy vectorization
   - Premature optimization without profiling data
   - Yet the domain (actuarial simulations) genuinely needs performance

4. **Strong Fundamentals**
   - 90%+ test coverage
   - Well-structured distribution models
   - Good domain modeling (PolicyTerms, Portfolio, etc.)
   - Working MCP server integration
   - Centralized development workflow (run_dev.py)

### What We Learned

1. **Over-engineering isn't always fatal** - The code works, has good tests, and ships features. Annoying but not blocking.

2. **Missing core features ARE fatal** - Can't be "quActuary" without quantum. This is existential.

3. **Performance matters in this domain** - Actuarial simulations run for hours. 2x speedup = real money saved.

4. **Architecture can wait** - Keep the high-level structure (PricingModel, strategies) but simplify implementations.

## Action Items Refined

### Immediate Priority (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement ONE real quantum algorithm (Amplitude Estimation for tail risk)
- [ ] Show actual quantum advantage for specific use case
- [ ] Don't beautify - just make it work

### Performance Fix (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Vectorize loops in classical.py
- [ ] Benchmark with real actuarial data
- [ ] Profile before adding any optimization

### Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Simplify modules when touching them
- [ ] Don't dedicate sprints to refactoring
- [ ] Delete unused code aggressively

### Low Priority
- [ ] File organization cleanup (15 min fix)
- [ ] Standardize import styles
- [ ] Consolidate benchmark files

## Technical Decisions

1. **Keep the strategy pattern** - It's built, it works, and we'll need it when quantum is real
2. **Don't refactor memory management** - Overengineered but functional, not blocking features
3. **Do vectorize the math** - This directly impacts performance for real use cases
4. **Ignore documentation bloat** - Verbose but not harmful

## Retrospective Insights

### What Went Well
- Built solid testing infrastructure early
- Created good abstractions for business domain
- Established development workflow patterns

### What Went Wrong
- Built framework before understanding the problem
- Optimized before profiling
- Added complexity before proving core value

### What We'll Do Differently
1. **Implement core value first** - No more infrastructure without quantum
2. **Profile before optimizing** - Measure, don't guess
3. **Simplify by default** - Start with 50 lines, expand only when needed
4. **Ship ugly working code** - Beautiful broken code has zero value

## The Carmack Principle

"It's not about writing the best code, it's about shipping the best product."

Current state: Beautiful garage, no car.  
Goal state: Ugly car that drives.

The path forward is clear: Build the quantum algorithm. Everything else is procrastination disguised as engineering.

## Next Sprint Focus

If we were to define a sprint starting tomorrow:

**Sprint Goal:** Demonstrate Quantum Advantage  
**Definition of Done:** One quantum algorithm computing real actuarial metrics faster/better than classical

Everything else waits.
