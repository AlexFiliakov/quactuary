# *qu*Actuary: quantum-powered actuarial tools

Quantum-powered actuarial tools for Python that dramatically accelerate risk calculations without requiring quantum programming expertise.

*This package is still under development, presently focused on Property & Casualty (non-life) techniques.*

## Roadmap
- Excess Loss Calculations
- Quantum Monte Carlo
- Reserving
  - IBNR Estimation
  - Basic Reserving Methods
  - Mack Method
- Generalized Linear Models
- Quantum Copula
- Risk-of-Ruin Collective Risk Models
- VaR and TVaR
- Tail Risk and Risk Margin Estimation
