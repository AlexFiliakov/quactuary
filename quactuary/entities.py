    A collection of Inforce objects, representing a portfolio of policies.
    This class is a subclass of list, so it can be used like a list of Inforce objects.

    It also provides additional methods for portfolio management.
    Attributes:
    ----------
    - `total_policies`: Returns the total number of policies in the portfolio.
    - `__add__`: Combines two portfolios into one.

    Usage:
    --------
    `portfolio = qa.Portfolio([wc_inforce, gl_inforce])`
