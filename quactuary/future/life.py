Life insurance module.
(Phase 4 features)

Purpose: Extend the framework to life insurance applications,
such as actuarial present value calculations, survival models,
and policy projections, while reusing existing life actuarial libraries where possible.

Contents: Potential modules like 
LifeTable (manages mortality tables, possibly leveraging standard datasets),
AnnuityModel (calculates present values, reserves for annuities or life policies)
ALMModel (asset-liability management specific to life insurers)

We will look for open-source libraries or data for life contingencies
(for instance, `lifelib` or mortality libraries) to integrate.
If none are suitable, these will be new implementations,
but designed to feel like typical actuarial software
(for example, methods to get life expectancies, cashflow projections as pandas DataFrames, etc.).

Quantum integration in life models might include speeding up large simulations
(e.g. nested stochastics for variable annuities) with quantum Monte Carlo.
This subpackage remains an area for future development,
structured to accommodate the specialized nature of life insurance calculations separately from P&C.
