"""
Tools for optimizing risk portfolios (ALM, capital allocation, etc.)
(Phase 3 features)

A possible implementation is to interface with optimization libraries
or even formulate problems for quantum optimization algorithms.
For example, we might use `PyPortfolioOpt` (for classical efficient frontier computation)
and also allow a quantum annealer or QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) backend
for a strategic asset allocation problem.

The API would remain high-level
e.g.: `opt = PortfolioOptimization(portfolio, constraints).solve(method='classical') vs `method='quantum'`.
