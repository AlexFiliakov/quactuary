Quantum actuarial integration module.

This module provides quantum computing capabilities for actuarial calculations using
Qiskit. It implements quantum algorithms for computing portfolio risk measures including
mean, variance, Value at Risk (VaR), and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR).

The module serves as the quantum computing foundation within the quactuary framework,
offering quantum-accelerated alternatives to classical Monte Carlo methods. It provides
consistent interfaces for quantum circuit construction, execution, and result extraction.

Key Features:
    - Quantum circuit construction for risk measure calculations
    - Integration with Qiskit for quantum algorithm execution
    - Support for various quantum backends (simulators and real hardware)
    - Quantum advantage for specific problem structures

Architecture:
    - QuantumPricingModel: Main class for quantum calculations
    - Individual quantum circuits for each risk measure
    - Backend-agnostic design supporting multiple quantum platforms

Current Status:
    This module is under active development. The quantum algorithms for actuarial
    applications are an area of ongoing research. Current implementations are
    placeholders for future quantum algorithm development.

Examples:
    Basic usage (when implemented):
        >>> from quactuary.quantum import QuantumPricingModel
        >>> from quactuary.book import Portfolio
        >>> from quactuary.backend import get_backend
        >>> 
        >>> # Create portfolio and quantum model
        >>> portfolio = Portfolio(policies_df)
        >>> quantum_backend = get_backend("quantum")
        >>> model = QuantumPricingModel()
        >>> 
        >>> # Calculate risk measures using quantum algorithms
        >>> result = model.calculate_portfolio_statistics(
        ...     portfolio=portfolio,
        ...     mean=True,
        ...     value_at_risk=True,
        ...     tail_alpha=0.05
        ... )

    Integration with pricing framework:
        >>> from quactuary.pricing import PricingModel
        >>> from quactuary.pricing_strategies import QuantumPricingStrategy
        >>> 
        >>> # QuantumPricingModel is used internally by QuantumPricingStrategy
        >>> strategy = QuantumPricingStrategy()
        >>> pricing_model = PricingModel(portfolio, strategy=strategy)

Notes:
    - Quantum algorithms may provide speedup for certain problem structures
    - Current quantum hardware has limitations (noise, qubit count, coherence time)
    - Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms often provide the best practical results
    - See the quantum computing literature for theoretical speedup analysis
