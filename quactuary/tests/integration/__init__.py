"""
Integration tests for quActuary performance optimization combinations.

This module contains comprehensive integration tests that validate the interaction
between different optimization strategies including JIT compilation, quasi-Monte Carlo
methods, parallel processing, vectorization, and memory management.

Test Categories:
- Optimization combination matrix testing
- End-to-end scenario validation
- Performance validation with metrics
- Accuracy and correctness verification
- Automatic optimization selection
- Real-world use case scenarios
- Configuration and environment testing
